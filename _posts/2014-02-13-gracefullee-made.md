- question: Ok - &#8220;Gracefullee Made&#8221; has to be the cutest blog name, ever.
    (Your full name is Grace Lee) What gave you the idea to use it?
  answer: Aw, thank you! Well, I'm a person who likes to stand out and I didn't want
    my blog name to be something common. Also, how many people do you know that can
    fit their full name into their blog name? Exactly. One of my close friends in
    high school used to call me 'Grace full Lee' and it seemed fitting to use as my
    blog name.
- question: Let's talk about your blog. It's filled with pink, glitter, and smiles!
    What made you want to get into blogging/launch your own blog, and how long have
    you been blogging for?
  answer: I liked to dress very stylishly in high school. It was rare for anyone to
    see me in a t-shirt or tennis shoes. On a daily basis, my classmates, friends,
    and even teachers would ask me where I got my clothes, shoes, accessories, etc.
    I decided it was best to blog about it. It was like having an online diary where
    I could post my looks, and then share what I was wearing. I have been blogging
    for four years now.
- question: How do you keep a steady following?
  answer: Two words&#058; social networking. I am an avid tweeter and instagram-mer.
    I try to write posts and say things that other bloggers and readers can relate
    to. Also, having an eye for what kind of shots you want is key. It's almost like
    being a salesman because you're constantly promoting your blog on social media
    and preserving the best image for it.
- question: Do you connect/network with other bloggers? How do you go about initiating
    those conversations?
  answer: I do! I've made a ton of blogger friends through social media, and I've
    only met a few of them in real life, but that's only because it's hard meeting
    up with bloggers that are many states away. But I do still keep in contact with
    them and even email them for upcoming blogger collaborations here and there. Usually,
    I'll just shoot them an email or a text and the conversation just flows. Is it
    crazy to be close with people you've never met? It's amazing how social media
    does that to us.
- question: What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit
    blogs?
  answer: Atlantic-Pacific, Pink Peonies, Cupcakes and Cashmere, Could I Have That?,
    and The Sweetest Thing are definitely a few of my favorite style inspirations
    and must-visit blogs. I'm particularly drawn to any blogs that can captivate readers
    with their words and creative photos.
- question: You blog from Chapel Hill, NC. How do your surroundings influence your
    style?
  answer: Every day, I'm surrounded by copious amounts of college students on campus
    as I go to class, run errands, and take blog shoots. Therefore, I see a lot of
    styles on a daily basis. It's definitely hard being motivated in Chapel Hill,
    especially because it's a college town and most people like to wear sportswear
    and hoodies to be comfortable in class. But luckily, Pinterest and other fashion
    blogs keep me inspired.
- question: Who's your favorite clothing designer?
  answer: Truth be told, most of my closest friends already know the answer to this
    one without even thinking twice about it. My favorite would have to be Kate Spade.
    I always stalk the NYFW collections every year and I simply cannot get enough
    of the brights, bows, and all things colorific.
- question: If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life,
    what would it be?
  answer: An A-line little black dress, a statement necklace, and a pair of colorful
    pumps. Classy and elegant.
- question: Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance
    with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?
  answer: Yes, I use sites like RewardStyle, Pradux, Chictopia, Pinterest, Lucky Community
    to share my blog posts and pictures with the fashion community. RewardStyle is
    a great way to not only find similar items, but also provides commission towards
    the blogger when that similar item is clicked on and purchased from the readers.
    My wonderful blog layout was created by Shannon Page Designs who did an amazing
    job at glamming up my site!
- question: What quote or mantra do you live by?
  answer: If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough.&#8220; That has
    to be one of my favorite quotes, hands down. I am constantly pushing myself to
    be better and to shoot for high expectations. I want to inspire others, but at
    the same time, inspire myself as well.
- question: What do you study as an undergrad? Has it helped you with your blog?
  answer: I'm currently studying journalism and mass communications. I always had
    a knack for writing. I use my blog not only for personal style posts, but also
    a way to express my thoughts to my readers. I think it's very important to have
    that voice as a fashion blogger. Majoring in journalism has helped with my blog.
    I'm currently taking a News Writing class, and it has really opened my eyes to
    information that I did not know about the world of journalism, and I am enjoying
    every step of the journey.
- question: Who takes your photos for you, and what kind of camera do you use?
  answer: When I first started my blog in high school, my younger brother who is 13,
    took my photos. Though, I technically dragged him outdoors most of the time, sometimes
    I want to say that he enjoyed playing &#8220;blog photographer&#8221; for me.
    Since bringing younger brothers with you to college isn't allowed, I rely on my
    older sister, who is a senior here in Chapel Hill, or one of my best friends Ginger
    Melton. They are both supportive of my blog in every way.
- question: Instagram or Twitter?
  answer: Instagram all the way. I'm a firm believer that pictures have a way of telling
    a story in a deeper perspective than words can.
- question: Vanilla or chocolate?
  answer: Chocolate. Lady Godiva has my heart.
- question: What's one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect
    to learn?
  answer: It has taught me to always be careful with what I say and how I say it.
    We live in a world where words can be taken out of context or used in a different
    manner, and that is always something everyone should be cautious of.
- question: What's the most rewarding component of blogging?
  answer: I'm pretty sure receiving free packages in the mail from companies trumps
    all rewarding components of being a blogger. Am I right? Okay, all jokes aside.
    But I do love mail days and keeping in contact with companies that sponsor me.
    I've met some pretty incredible people and it's nice to know that. It's so great
    being able to boost both of our followers simply by helping each other out.

She may only be 18 years old, but **Grace Lee** of **Gracefullee Made** never fails to impress us. The University of North Carolina journalism student adores Kate Spade, smiling, and A-line cuts. She also has a keen sense of awareness, knowledge, and experience when it comes to social networking and engaging with other bloggers and brands - most likely stemming from her fearless, hands-on approach to blogging. Given the quote she lives by, "if your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough", we can't be too shocked that she's had so much success. In fact, we're more than convinced that it will continue indefinitely.

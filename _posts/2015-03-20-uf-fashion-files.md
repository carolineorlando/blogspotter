  - question: How long ago did you start UF Fashion Files?
    answer: I started UF Fashion Files in fall 2012 as a class assignment, but later fell in love with blogging and continued to post for the next 3 years.
  - question: When you started your blog, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?
    answer: Originally, I wanted to feature only University of Florida students and their fashionable outfits. But, when my course load piled up and my free time on campus vanished, I started to tweak my site to have more fashion tips as well as outfit ideas. During the summer months, I photographed looks I wore back home and featured them on my blog. Now, my blog is more personal with outfit ideas, inspiration posts and more.
  - question: Do you blog full-time, or is it just a hobby right now?
    answer: Blogging is definitely a hobby for me, since I’m still in school right now.
  - question: We all know the saying&#58; a photo speaks a thousand words. What’s the key to taking a good photo?
    answer: When I take photos, or have photos taken, I always make sure there’s a ton of options. I’ve learned over time what are the most flattering angles and how to operate my DSLR to get high-quality images. The key is just to practice!
  - question: How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?
    answer: I love blogging. It can get tough at times when I feel overwhelmed with school and my internship. But, when I have free time, I love putting up a new post and connecting with my readers.
  - question: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
    answer: I would say that my style is classic and comfortable. I grew up in California, so I definitely embodied that Southern California laid-back style when it comes to getting dressed. I always reach for comfy soft shirts and flowy dresses.
  - question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
    answer: In five years, I see myself working at a fashion or women’s magazine as a contributing writer. I would also hope to freelance for other publications on the side, as well as still write for my blog!
  - question: QUICK! Pink gold or yellow gold?
    answer: Pink gold! I have two rose gold diamond rings and a rose gold dainty heart necklace that I wear every day.
  - question: If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?
    answer: That’s a hard choice. My outfit changes on my mood, as cliche as that sounds! But my go-to look is always a chambray shirt with jeans and ballet flats. You can’t ever go wrong and you’re always comfortable! I love fun accessories, so with a look like this, I’ll wear bright shoes or a cool bag and my favorite pair of sunglasses.
  - question: What has social media done for your blog? What platform has had the biggest impact on your audience growth?
    answer: Social media is one of my favorite parts of blogging. I love Instagram; it’s always awesome getting inspiration from designers and other bloggers, as well as meeting other college fashion bloggers. It’s such a great way to not only spread your blog’s influence, but make new friends, too.
  - question: What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?
    answer: How important a media kit can be. I made one for my site over the summer and I didn’t realize how fun it would be to put together! It has helped a lot with collaborations and building business connections. I love working with design so I’m hoping one day I can redesign my blog myself.
  - question: If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?
    answer: There are a few minor things I would have tweaked but for the most part, I love my blog. It’s definitely been a learning experience, but a fun one! I never blog when I can’t put my 110% of effort into it because I want my readers to really enjoy what I post. The one thing I would change would be my name, since I am graduating in May. But, that’s easily changeable and I may already have something coming up in the future (wink, wink).
  - question: What quote or mantra do you live by?
    answer: I don't know who said it but I love the quote "Don’t be like the rest of them, darling." I painted it on a canvas for my freshman year of college as a little daily reminder to stay true to myself. It’s still one of my favorites!
  - question: Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?
    answer: Just have fun. So many more people are blogging now, so it’s important to just be unique and continue to post as long as you’re enjoying it. Blogs are supposed to be fun not only for your readers, but for you, as well. So don’t be afraid to try something new and write about it; you’re making memories that you’ll never forget.

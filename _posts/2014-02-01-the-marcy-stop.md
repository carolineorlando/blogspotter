interview:
- question: Tell us about the name of your blog, The Marcy Stop. Where did it come
    from?
  answer: The Marcy Stop is a reference to my subway stop in Brooklyn&#058; Marcy
    Ave. It's the first stop out on the JMZ train, and one of the main entry points
    into South Williamsburg. Conceptually, I always wanted the blog to be very neighborhood-centric,
    and I knew it was important for the name to represent that. A few martinis later
    with my close friend Micol, one of the original co-founders of the blog, and the
    name became final.
- question: How long have you been blogging for?
  answer: I've been blogging for a little over two years now. Crazy how time flies!
- question: What was it that really made you want begin blogging?
  answer: It was really Micol, my former blogging partner-in-crime, who pushed me
    to start the blog. She was looking for an outlet to practice her photography and
    I was looking for a creative side-project, so it wasn’t hard for her to convince
    me to join forces and collaborate. Since then it’s quickly become a passion project
    of my own.
- question: Did you study fashion and/or style as an undergraduate? If not, how did
    you learn the ins-and-outs of the industry?
  answer: I went to school at NYU and studied Graphic Communications as an undergrad
    (a mix of PR, Graphic Design and Advertising/Media), so academically I was definitely
    on this route. However, the eclectic assortment of internships I took part in
    and the jobs that followed, were what truly influenced my views on fashion. One
    of my first internships was working as an assistant to fashion writer Karen Robinovitz,
    followed by stints at companies like YSL, Gucci, Harrison and Shriftman, and FOX.
    When I finally graduated, I wound up working at a celebrity magazine for a few
    months, spent a few years in fashion public relations, then took on a freelance
    gig as a fashion editor at Rizzoli. I’m currently a design director at the Brooklyn-based
    creative agency, HOWL Group, where I work with a variety of fashion and lifestyle
    clients. Needless to say, I’ve had a wide range of experiences in fashion, and
    the opportunity to view the industry from so many angles has given me a truly
    unique perspective.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: My personal style really depends on my mood. Sometimes it's boho and eclectic.
    Other times it's modern and clean. However, I'm obsessed with vintage and thrift
    store shopping, so regardless of my mood, it’s always about mixing in those one-of-a-kind
    finds with more classic, tailored, or high-end pieces. And ultimately, it's all
    about comfort and feeling great in what I'm wearing.
- question: What other blogs/websites do you follow for inspiration?
  answer: A few of my favorite blogs/sites at the moment are&#058; Le 21eme, Lellavictoria,
    Purse 'N Boots, and A Pretty Pass, but I'm always on the search for new blogs
    and inspiration! When it comes to more mainstream coverage I love Refinery 29
    because they really dive into everything from fashion and beauty, to entertaining
    and décor. Instagram has also become a great source of inspo for me, but it takes
    longer to peruse.
- question: If you had $1,000 to spend on a wardrobe piece, what would you spend it
    on? (and why!)
  answer: I'd probably put the money towards a Chanel bag. It's such a classic piece
    that can stand the test of time and be easily dressed up or down.
- question: Red or nude colored nail polish?
  answer: Like fashion, my nails always depend on my mood. I'm big on DIY nail art,
    and change up my nail polish a few times per week, so I've tried every color/pattern
    under the sun.
- question: What are your favorite trends this season?
  answer: Fringe, full skirts, and sheer paneling. I'm a sucker for different cuts
    and fun details.
- question: If you could offer a few words of wisdom to an aspiring blogger, what
    would they be?
  answer: Do it because you love it, and not for the promise of free clothes or instafame.
    If you're passionate about your blog and your style, your readers will be able
    to tell, and you'll develop a following over time.
- question: What's the most rewarding component of blogging?
  answer: The most rewarding component has been getting out from behind the computer
    and camera and having a chance to meet and mingle with other bloggers and fashion
    industry insiders. Whether attending an event, setting up a brunch date with another
    blogger, or collaborating with a new company, the opportunity to socialize with
    other creative people and work with up-and-coming brands has really given me the
    most joy and fulfillment when it comes to blogging.

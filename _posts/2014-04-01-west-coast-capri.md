interview:
  - question: When you started West Coast Capri, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?
    answer: When I started, it was much more about our life in LA with not as much fashion, but then my readers started requesting more fashion and those were the most popular posts so it became much more of a fashion blog then I had originally planned. I think it’s important to adapt to what your readers want so I love where it’s at right now and everything I’m writing about.
  - question: Your blog features life, fashion, design and inspiration. What made you want to include these categories?
    answer: As an interior designer, I have written a blog that was just about design in the past, but I found that I love so many things that I wanted a place to include all of my passions and that includes everything in the fashion world, home décor, traveling, and trying new recipes in the kitchen.
  - question: You post a lot of personal style. How would you describe yours? 
    answer: My style varies from preppy and tom-boy to dressed up and elegant. That’s what I love about fashion so much is that I can try different looks all the time. But most of all, I try to keep the staples of my wardrobe with the classic pieces that last through the years and don’t go in and out with the seasons.
  - question: Has your style changed throughout the years? Has it changed since you became a mommy?
    answer: My style has become more mature over the years, but since being a mom I think the only thing that has changed is that I go for a lot more comfortable and functional pieces in my closet since I’m chasing a little one around all day.
  - question: Where are some of your favorite places to shop for you and your daughter?
    answer: I am a complete JCrew fanatic and so of course I love crewcuts as well. I also love Zara, Madewell, and Anthropologie just to name a few.
  - question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
    answer: I can never have enough chambray shirts. I love every shade of denim and they just go with everything. I could wear one everyday.
  - question: Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?
    answer: Basics with bold accessories – my collection of statement necklaces is growing rapidly.
  - question: What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?
    answer: I have always been drawn to floral patterns and stripes - they are definitely my favorites. Especially for this spring, I love all the beautiful florals I’ve seen. Neutral shades of tans and whites have always been a big majority of the colors in my closet, but lately I am wearing lots of blues and more black than usual.
  - question: Does your interior design work inform your clothing choices, and vice versa?
    answer: I definitely think it plays a big part. The color scheme that I am loving for a room design is often colors that I love putting into an outfit. Lighting is one of my favorite accessories in a room because it’s like the jewelry that just adds the perfect eye-candy to your look and I love dressing up an outfit with accessories as well.
  - question: How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?
    answer: I have loved writing my blog. I feel like all the hard work is so worth it when you meet wonderful readers who are inspired by your work.
  - question: What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?
    answer: I would have to say that getting to work with amazing brands that I have looked up to and been inspired by their style has been one of my favorite things.
  - question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
    answer: Learning the whole blogging industry has been so eye-opening, but also realizing how much hard work goes into every detail of a blog. I’ve loved getting to know so many other bloggers and I’ve realized how important it is to lift one another up and celebrate others successes.
  - question: About how long does an average blog post take?
    answer: That’s hard to say because some are more work than others, especially planning a party but probably on average it’s 3-4 hours.
  - question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
    answer: I hope to inspire others to live a more beautiful life through fashion by helping women look and feel their best, as well as creating your home into a space you love and cooking beautiful meals for your family.
  - question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers interested in fashion and interior design?
    answer: My advice would be to find your own voice and what makes you unique because then your strengths will set you apart. I would also recommend that you find resources around you to help with the skills you need to be a successful blogger such as photography, photoshop skills, graphic design, social media expertise, web design, and writing. But most of all I would say to it needs to be something you’re passionate about because there is a lot of work involved, but when you love it then it won’t feel like work.

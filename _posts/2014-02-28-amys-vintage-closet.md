- question: Tell us about you and your self-titled blog.
  answer: I launched Amy's Vintage Closet at the end of 2011. I was looking for a
    creative outlet and space where I could showcase my love for all things fashion,
    specifically thrifted or vintage items. From a young age I can remember mixing
    and matching things, constantly changing my clothing and always feeling excited
    by a great find or buy. I manage my family's pizzerias. The average day for a
    restaurant manager is far from glamorous. As our company grew and my job became
    more demanding I found myself working more and rarely getting the opportunity
    to wear some of my favorite pieces from my closet. My hope is that Amy's Vintage
    Closet can show other women that you don't have to dress like a mannequin or buy
    everything name brand or full-price. True style comes from within and has no boundaries.
- question: So - what was it that really made you want to blog?
  answer: I started this blog to create a healthy, adult outlet for myself. I often
    get asked what I am wearing or where I got something and having a visual database
    of my outfits helps a lot. Blogging is very much a positive release that I never
    knew I needed before. I look forward to blogging after a busy day.
- question: You have lived (literally) all over the world! Has this had an influence
    on your style?
  answer: Absolutely! I often find a lot of my style inspiration from street style.
    I would definitely say this really took off for me while living in the Vancouver,
    BC area. I had never seen such eclectic individual style like Vancouver. San Diego
    isn't a huge city on the fashion map in my opinion, but one thing I loved about
    living there was the laid back, effortlessly chic beach style. The women in San
    Diego have some of the best skin and hair I have ever seen. I felt like I really
    became obsessed with layering there. With temperatures in the mid 60's & 70's
    everyday, there's always a need for a few layered pieces. I have lived in Phoenix
    for a good portion of my adult life. It has been very fun to watch the fashion
    scene here grow and develop. One thing that Phoenix specifically has is store
    access. The city is conveniently set up for shopping. You can pretty much find
    anything you're looking when shopping in Phoenix.
- question: Tell us&#058; what was (or is!) your favorite place to live?
  answer: My favorite place to live is Phoenix. My life is very much established here
    and I do not see myself moving anytime soon. I am such a sun lover. If I could
    lay out in the sun, by the pool everyday I would (obviously with sunscreen). Most
    cities have 2-3 months of good weather where we have about 8 months of heaven.
    The summers are rough on everyone, but I will take the heat over snow any day.
    I also am a sucker for 100degrees. It is my favorite temperature.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: This is always hard for me to answer. My style is a direct reflection of
    my mood. Sometimes I feel very girly and sophisticated and other times all I want
    to wear is all black. I love a good pair of heels, but sneakers are also adding
    up quickly in my closet. Most of my daily outfits that I post on my Instagram
    are casual, laid back, wearable looks that I can put on at 7am and last until
    8pm. Most of my outfit posts that you see on my blog are looks that I have time
    to put together.
- question: If you could wear one outfit everyday, what would it be?
  answer: This one changes all the time, but I would have to say I am most comfortable
    in a Men's Medium t-shirt, leggings/shorts, and sneakers/sandals. I love mixing
    an ordinary basic outfit with fun statement jewelry like a big necklace, multiple
    bracelet stack, and sunnies of course.
- question: What clothing or beauty item could you never live without?
  answer: Clothing item, probably hats. Hats come in handy no matter what the season
    is and can add so much personality to a look. Beauty item I cannot live without
    would be my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. I am not a huge makeup fan so this
    is a perfect quick product that I throw on and run out the door when I don’t have
    time for makeup.
- question: Do you have a must-wear accessory or go to staple that you include in
    every outfit?
  answer: Yes! I have a few vintage & monogrammed necklaces that I wear almost every
    day. Some of them are new in the rotation and others have been passed down to
    me from family members. I am sucker for anything monogrammed. I also wear a ruby
    and diamond ring that my father gave to my mother 38 years ago when they first
    started dating that I wear everyday.
- question: How has blogging helped develop your styling skills?
  answer: One of the best things about blogging is being involved in the blogging
    community. It is such an inspiring group of individuals doing their thing across
    the world. I get a lot of my inspiration from other bloggers. Street-style is
    so authentic & raw which is the best thing about individual style.
- question: What has blogging taught you?
  answer: Blogging has taught me many things. You are literally putting yourself out
    there for the world to see, criticize, and comment on. That's a very intimidating
    task. I feel like it has made my skin a little tougher, stretched my comfort zone
    further and helped encourage my self-confidence.
- question: What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?
  answer: Have a goal and a purpose from the start. I think it's easy to get overwhelmed
    by the amount of other people who are trying to do what you're doing, but that's
    the beauty of it. There is room for everyone in the fashion blogging world. That
    being said, you really should try to strive to be original and authentic in all
    that you do. Try not to compare what you’re doing to someone else. Comparison
    kills passion and without passion whatever you’re doing is essentially useless.

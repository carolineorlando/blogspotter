_We're glad that **Christine Reabe** found the courage to start her blog **xo Christine Marie**. It is the perfect snapshot of her style - everything from casual cool to date night glam. A self-proclaimed tried and true beach girl, she gravitates to calm, earthy hues like gold and teal (also her favorite color!), prefers red over pink (in a heartbeat!), and respects what social media has done for her blog and it's growth. Learn more about Christine and xo Christine Marie by getting to know her with Blogspotter below._

**Tell us about your semi-self titled blog, "xo Christine Marie".** xo Christine Marie is style blog where I showcase anything from work attire, causal comfy everyday outfits to weekend date night ensembles.

**When did you first start blogging?** I began blogging in September 2012 and it's crazy to think about how much my blog has changed in that short year and a half. It began as a teacher inspired blog where I would post my work outfits along side teacher crafts. After a cross-country move, career change, and learning more about my audience it has evolved into a style blog of all sorts. I am so proud of the direction it has taken and can't help but cringe a little when I look back to those first few posts. The thought of deleting some of the most embarrassing ones has definitely crossed my mind but it’s a good reminder of how much my blog has grown and matured.

**What was it that made you want to launch xo Christine Marie?** I started my obsession with the blogosphere when I relocated for my first teaching position. I moved 4 hours from my parents to a town I didn't know a soul for a job where I didn’t know anyone. I filled my free time with shopping and catching up on blogs. After a year of regular blog reading and many teachers at my school inquiring about my outfits and jewelry I started mulling around the idea of starting a blog of my own. After months of reading blogging books, nervous thoughts of people critics, and numerous design ideas I finally had the courage to make it happen.

**We love your style! It's so girly and feminine, yet very professional. How would you self-describe your style, in a few words?** My favorite thing about fashion is its versatility. Everyday I can be something different. Some days I feel like throwing on a biker jacket and studded heels, the next a J Crew skirt and cardigan and by the weekend I am all about cut off shorts and a flower in my hair. To sum up my everyday style I would say conservative with a touch of beach inspired casual.

**What's one piece in your wardrobe that you can't live without?** It has to be a good skinny jean. My body type is far from a model's, I'm not stick thin and I measure up at only 5'3! So when you finally find that pair that fits like a glove it’s as if the clouds have parted and angels sing. Let's be honest, a good fitting jean completes any look.

**If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?** The older I get the more I realize it's all about the hunt. I prefer browsing the Internet, shopping at vintage stores, or paroozing the never-ending rows at TJ Maxx than sticking to one particular store. When you read my blog you know I am a self proclaimed Maxxinista. My high school self, who was a strictly a labels girl would cringe at that last statement. The older I get the less I care for labels and the more thrive off the awesome find. Maybe it’s because I am shopping with my own money now? But I'll just credit it to the fact I am more 'mature'!

**Let's talk about social media. Do you find that social media has played a very important role in the growth of xo Christine Marie?** Social media has been a huge part of my growth. Being that I blog about fashion, pictures are a crucial aspect in drawing readers to my page. Which in turn has made me obsessed with Instagram and Pinterest. Both have been my biggest platforms in showcasing my outfits. I still find it crazy when I scroll through the popular page of pinterest and come across pictures of myself. Not to mention when I spot one with thousands of pins, I think 'wow that many people enjoyed what I put together'!

**Your logo is so cute! Did you design it yourself? How did you come up with the idea for it? (we love the hanger!)** Thank you! As I mentioned before I went through quite a few design options when first brainstorming the idea of my own blog. Jenn from Hello, Brio Studio designed my first layout. After a few months of blogging I contacted Jenn a second time when I was more comfortable with the direction my blog was going. I knew I wanted something sleek and simple. My boyfriend is an amazing artist and I told him I wanted something elegant and exampled the hanger idea and voila, he delivered! Thanks to Jenn I was able to make it come alive.

**How are you feeling about the statement piece trend? Do you prefer one chunky piece of jewelry, or lots of dainty pieces?** Wow, do I have to pick just one? My jewelry collection is larger than I would like to admit and I was suckered right into the statement jewelry trend. I own a statement piece in just about every shape and color. Just recently I have become Etsy obsessed (if there was an Etsy Addicts Anonymous I would be first in line) and I have been strictly buying dainty layering pieces. But my absolute favorite has been a simple outfit, a statement piece and some long layered dainty pieces; best of both worlds!

**Who takes your photographs for you? They’re beauty-full!** Thank you! My awesome and supportive boyfriend takes all of my pictures. Some days I have to bribe him with some chocolate or a beer when it’s a football Sunday and I have to a deadline to meet but he is such an important part of my blog. His help and support has really made it what it is today.

**QUICK! Red or pink?** Red all the way! Nothing beats a good red lip or flirty red pump.

**QUICK! Gold finish or silver finish?** Easy, without a doubt, gold. Sometimes I need to remind myself of all the great silver pieces I own because I tend to always gravitate towards my gold pieces.

**What's the most rewarding component of blogging?** The most rewarding component of blogging has been the followers and fellow bloggers I've met. The blogosphere has such a sense of community with so many uplifting people. I have made some great friends through this competitive blogging world whom I now know on a personal level. Sometimes I have to take a step back and giggle when I am out with fellow bloggers and think about how I never would have met them if it weren’t for taking that leap of faith in starting my own blog.

**What's the coolest thing that's happened to you since you started xo Christine Marie?** The coolest thing was when I received an email from something simply telling me they were a 'fan'. I thought "I have fans?!", "People actually look forward to my next post?" They may be my only 'fan', aside from my mom, but it's pretty cool knowing I have at least one.

**QUICK! What’s your favorite color?** Teal! I'm a beach girl tried and true and you can find little pops of teal in my wardrobe, jewelry, apartment and even my blog design. Sometimes I have to tell myself "Christine, you don't need that 10th teal necklace!"

**If you could offer one piece of must-have advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be?** It may sound silly because I've read it in books and people are always saying it but that’s because it's true – you have to be yourself. But I will add a second part to that, take your time. When I first began my blog I tried to be very 'by the book'. I have a Masters degree and am quite the perfectionist in my everyday life so my blog has been no different. But after a year of blogging I had to take a step back and remind myself why I blog. To share my story, my clothes, and what I love. I use to rush to put together an outfit just because 'I hadn’t posted in a few days' or think 'everyone is posting holiday trends so I should probably get on that too' but that has since changed. Now that I have slowed down I think my posts have become richer, my outfits are more true to what I want to represent and I am much happier with the final product. It's about having fun!

**You started blogging as a way to document the end of your twenties. Were there any other reasons you started? What made you continue?** I guess to hold me accountable. That's a strange way of putting it but I found myself in a rut and thought if I starting documenting my life, outfits, etc., I wouldn't get so lazy. Now, that I'm a mom, I want to document every aspect of my son's life so I never forget these moments. So I continue blogging to document this awesome time right now and because I love connecting with readers.

**How did you come up with the name for your blog?** The name, honestly, came about because I liked both words. I wish there was a deeper reason!

**Has being a mommy changed your fashion choices at all?** Absolutely! I get dressed before my son wakes up so I always choose to wear something comfortable because I know as soon as he’s up, I’m going to be running around.

**How would you describe your personal style?** I would say classic and comfortable. Sometimes people associate the word comfortable with boring but I think, at least for myself, if I'm not comfortable, I'm not going to feel great which will translate into whatever I’m wearing.

**What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?** Tory Burch flats, Maxi Dress, Boyfriend Cardigan, Louis Vuitton Speedy, Chanel Flap (totally not practical but it’s my love!)

**What are your most-loved color and texture combinations?** Black and White. Simple and Classic.

**As an attorney, does your work style differ from your normal, everyday style?** My normal, everyday style is very relaxed versus what I wear to work which is usually a pencil skirt and top. You never know if there’s going to be an emergency hearing so I always dress for work with that in mind and know that I can throw a blazer on and be ready to go.

**What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?** I had my son! I loved blogging my pregnancy outfits and sometimes go back through my archives just to see my massive preggo belly!

**What was the process of starting your blog like?** Thankfully, my husband is supportive and tech savvy. He very much built the blog for me and taught me how to manage it.

**What has maintaining a blog taught you?** Diligence. Sometimes I skip days here and there in posting but then I get the urge to want to do 5 posts in a row. I just love blogging and getting inspiration from others too.

**Tell us about the Modcloth Uniquely You campaign and what that entailed. Have you been involved in any similar projects?** The Modcloth Uniquely You campaign was so much fun because it was like I got to shop and create my perfect outfit! I've never been involved with another project like that before but I certainly will enjoy the opportunity to get to do it again.

**Do you have any plans for your blog’s future?** My life is certainly changing (for the best) and so I hope to share more about being a working mother, sharing outfit ideas, and, of course, my little fashionable son, Lucas.

**Any advice for aspiring mommy bloggers?** Mommy blogs are definitely one of my favorites to read and I love when mommy bloggers are honest. My advice is to try not to be like anyone else but yourself.

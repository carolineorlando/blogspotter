interview:
  - question: We love your blog! Tell us a little bit about it.
    answer: My blog is a creative outlet for everything I have to say in a visual and text based format. I highlight fashion and sprinkle in a few savvy beauty tips and a dash of sassy lifestyle events.
  - question: When did you officially start blogging, and what was it that made you want to start?
    answer: I officially started blogging in November of 2013 like many, current, and future bloggers I had always wanted to start a blog. What inspired me to pursue blogging was the realization that I had become a blogger without a blog! I had been dabbling in guest posting for other blogs and finally the light went off that I could actually do this. I then created Miss Erin Says as a creative space to share my passions.
  - question: You blog about fashion, beauty, and lifestyle - what’s your favorite thing to blog about, and why?
    answer: My favorite thing to blog about would be fashion and my personal style. When I started my blog I didn’t want to limit myself so I incorporated multiple categories. Over time my favorite highlights have been fashion focused. I think this is due to my true appreciation for clothing as most of my life I didn’t fit into "traditional" sizes. After a weight loss journey I now am on a fashion journey and I love sharing and inspiring others along the way.
  - question: Where do you find blogging inspiration?
    answer: My blogging inspiration is found within other like-minded women. Diane Von Furstenberg's quote sums it up best. "The success of every single woman is an inspiration for another." — D.V.F
  - question: How would you describe your personal style?
    answer: I would describe my personal style as classic and feminine with a twist. I love structured garments and classic iconic shapes. Statement pieces with unique details are what draw me. I believe in wardrobe focal points often found in the form of a great handbag! My go to wardrobe piece is a dramatic skirt thus the twist.
  - question: QUICK! Polka dots or stripes?
    answer: STRIPES!
  - question: QUICK! Lipstick or lipgloss?
    answer: Matte Lipstick
  - question: How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?
    answer: Blogging has been a journey and a getaway into a world that I love. I would say that it has definitely been a worthwhile endeavor. As I have met so many inspirational people. I have learned a ton about myself thus far and learned to challenge myself.
  - question: Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?
    answer: My best friend turned photographer William (a.k.a. Billy) takes my photos. We currently shoot with a Nikon D5300 but we started with an iPhone5 and well now we are here.
  - question: What’s your take on social media? How has social media generally helped with the branding of your blog?
    answer: My take on social media is that is is an amazingly powerful tool that is ever evolving and changing. In terms of branding social media has been a great tool to assist my brand in reaching new audience worldwide.
  - question: What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?
    answer: That would have to be having the honor of meeting Tory Burch. She was a joy and is one of the most humble, genuine and talented individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.
  - question: What has maintaining a blog taught you so far?
    answer: Maintaining a blog has taught me about flexibility. I naturally have a type “A” personality so this has been a challenge for me but I am now learning the fine art of flexibility.
  - question: What’s one thing that blogging has taught you?
    answer: Blogging has taught me to step outside comfort zone in multiple arenas including social scenarios and within my personal style
  - question: If your best friend decided to launch her own blog, what piece of advice would you give her?
    answer: My advice would be to define three things your voice, who you want to inspire, and why you want to blog. Once you have defined these three aspects REMEMBER them and utilize them throughout your journey as your guides. Then make a plan A and after you have devised plan A be ready for that plan to change. Because, after all, there are 26 letters in the alphabet.

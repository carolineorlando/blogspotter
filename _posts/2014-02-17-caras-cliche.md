  - question: We love the name &#8220;Cara's Cliche&#8221;, but we love the tagline &#8220;Start the Cliche, Don’t Become One&#8221; even more. How did you come up with both the name of your blog and the tagline - which came first?
    answer: When I was trying to think of a name for my blog I wanted something that truly represented both my personality and my style. Everything seemed so similar to a blog that was already out there. My husband turned to me out of the blue one night and said &#8220;What about 'Cara's Cliche', you have always had your own sense of style that you stay true to no matter what&#8221;. To be completely honest initially I wasn't a fan, but the more I thought about it the more the name grew on me and I came to love it. The tagline just came to me after that. Both were my way of saying wear what you love despite what anybody else may think of it. Kind of like making &#8220;fetch&#8221; happen, there is always a way to make it work.
  - question: How long have you been blogging for?
    answer: Since January 2013, I can't believe it has been over a year already!
  - question: You're pretty active on Instagram and Twitter, what's your favorite social media platform both personally and for Cara’s Cliche?
    answer: Definitely Instagram. Being a mom I am all about capturing life through pictures, it goes by too quickly not to have a way to look back on it all.
  - question: Your photos are stunning! Who takes your pictures for you?
    answer: It started out for the first several months being only my husband. Emma came to me one night and asked if she could please try. The rest is history and now it’s about a 60/40 split between my daughter and husband. My daughter's eye for photography at just 9 years old amazes me more and more every single day and my husband's artistic side has always been one of the things I admire most about him.
  - question: What kind of camera do you use? Do you edit all of your photos by yourself?
    answer: I use a Nikon DSLR 5100 - I am still learning I do edit all of my photos by myself. Thank goodness for user friendly programs like Lightroom!
  - question: Who's your favorite designer right now?
    answer: Preen. The prints and sophisticated lines get me season after season.
  - question: If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?
    answer: Chanel, hands down, that is if my wallet would allow of course.
  - question: How would you describe your style in 3 adjectives?
    answer: Sophisticated, comfortable, fresh.
  - question: What's your favorite always-wear accessory?
    answer: I truly can't pick just one. I never take off my Michael Kors watch but can't get enough of my Enlightened Goddess shark tooth necklace and citrine ring (her pieces are unique while still being incredibly versatile).
  - question: QUICK! Pinstripe or solid seersucker blazer?
    answer: Pinstripe! When in doubt always opt for the unexpected details.
  - question: Mint chocolate chip or strawberry ice cream?
    answer: Mint chocolate chip, anything with chocolate and I am sold!
  - question: How do you network with other bloggers? Do you typically find that it’s easier to initiate conversation through your blog (comments) or through social media?
    answer: Events are always a great way to network but between family life and my day job they are not always easy to make it to. Both Instagram and blog comments have helped me build lasting relationships. I have made so many unexpected and amazing friends through both avenues.
  - question: Do you frequent any online resources/websites for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?
    answer: I am going to kick myself later for admitting this but no. There are several blogs I love and make sure to check out day to day though!
  - question: What's one thing blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?
    answer: As corny as it may sound blogging has taught me that support comes from every angle. I have had so many readers email me and let me know how much they look forward to my posts and that I have inspired them in some way. That was definitely something I never expected but am so incredibly grateful for every single day!
  - question: If you were to give one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be and why?
    answer: Don't abandon who you are or your own personal style because it's what sets you apart!

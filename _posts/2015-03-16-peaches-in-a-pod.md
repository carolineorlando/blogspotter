interview:
- question: How did you meet?
  answer: Whitney grew up with Blaire’s husband and both families have been friends
    for many years. When Blaire started dating her husband we were always together.
    It’s crazy that we have known each other for more than 15 years!
- question: How long ago did you start Peaches In A Pod?
  answer: Peaches In A Pod was started in January of 2014, so we are wee babes in
    the blog world.
- question: The name (Peaches In A Pod) is so cute! How did you come up with it?
  answer: We have always shared a similar style, and we are always talking fashion,
    so we are definitely two peas in a pod in that aspect.  We also knew that we wanted
    to incorporate the fact that we are from Georgia, so put those two together, and
    Peaches In A Pod was born.
- question: When you started Peaches In A Pod, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed
    pretty true to that original idea?
  answer: We have always inspired each other when it comes to fashion, so we started
    this blog as a way to inspire other women, like us. We have definitely stuck to
    that ideal, and we hope to continue to inspire with our own fashion experiments.
- question: Your photos are so beautiful! Who takes your photos for you?
  answer: Well thank you! We take our own pictures. We make it really fun by leaving
    the kids and husbands at home and go on outfit shoots. We change in the car in
    remote locations. Changing into skinny jeans behind a steering wheel gets us into
    fits of hysterics, and by the end there are hangers, shoes and accessories everywhere!
- question: How does living in Georgia influence your style?
  answer: The weather in Georgia is constantly changing. It could be in the 40’s in
    the morning and above 70 by the afternoon, so we incorporate a lot of layers into
    our style.
- question: How do you balance family/work/life with blogging?
  answer: We are still working on that! Thank goodness there are two of us! <br><br>B&#58;
    I work during the day when my kids are at school. <br><br>W&#58; I stay at home
    with my 2 year old and work from home, so juggling that plus the blog has it challenges.
    It’s amazing how much I can accomplish during nap time!
- question: Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have
    a favorite blog?
  answer: B&#58; My blog inspiration is Sequins and Things. I just love her style!  <br><br>W&#58;
    I'm loving Southern Curls and Pearls. Caitlin is fabulous and her style is so
    well put together!
- question: Where do you see yourself (with Peaches In A Pod) in a year?
  answer: That's a great question! We are planning on making the blog bigger and better
    by improving the site itself. We want to improve speed and functionality. Hopefully
    switching blog platforms will allow us to do that.
- question: QUICK&#58; Peach cobbler or peach lemonade?
  answer: B&#58; Cobbler definitely! <br><br>W&#58; OMG both are in my top 5 favorite
    things! Cobbler!
- question: If you could only wear one outfit every day for the rest of your life,
    what would it be?
  answer: B&#58; Skinny jeans with a great jacket and statement booties. <br><br>W&#58;
    A fit and flare dress, cropped jacket and booties or wedges depending on the season.
    I am totally a dress girl!
- question: What camera do you use?
  answer: Canon DSLR.
- question: How long, from start to finish, does it take to complete a blog post?
  answer: From idea to publication, it takes about a week. We have several drafts
    in the works at all times.
- question: How has social media impacted your blog’s audience? Do you have a favorite
    platform?
  answer: Social media has helped us grow our audience tremendously! Instagram is
    probably our favorite, but we also love interacting with brands on Twitter.
- question: What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect
    to learn?
  answer: We didn't expect to make the friendships that we have made. We love getting
    to meet and interact with other bloggers. You would think as a blogger, that you
    sit in an office all day on a computer, but we are constantly in contact with
    other bloggers, and it has really been refreshing.
- question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
  naswer: When we started this blog, we had no idea what we were doing, or if we would
    have any readers. We are so grateful for each and every viewer, and we are blessed
    to get to do what we love.
- question: Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?
  answer: Building a blog community has been the most helpful in getting our blog
    going. Joining surrounding blog societies and reaching out to other bloggers has
    not only built up an audience, but also made this process a lot of fun.

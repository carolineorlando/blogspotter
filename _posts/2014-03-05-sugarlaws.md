interview:
- question: Why is your blog called Sugarlaws? Does it have to do with your sweet
    tooth?
  answer: Sugarlaws actually started as a food and recipe blog for the first year
    and a half! I added fashion in 2009, so people sometimes forget that it was about
    food before it was about fashion!
- question: You blog about food and style. Why did you decide to cover both topics
    on one blog?
  answer: Food and fashion are two huge loves of mine, and I couldn't imagine my life
    without either! Both food and fashion are about making life beautiful, happy and
    comfortable – or as I like to say, living sweetly!
- question: How long have you been blogging and why did you start?
  answer: I've been blogging since 2008, which is about a century in internet-years!
    I started Sugarlaws as a way to keep track of all the new recipes I was making
    in my tiny Manhattan kitchen, but it soon became a way to chronicle the last five
    years of my life.
- question: Tell us about the experience of attending New York Fashion Week.
  answer: Fashion Week is always such a blast! It's so incredibly inspiring to see
    all the hard work and effort come together on the runways, and to get a sense
    of the styles we'll all be drooling over in the coming year. I've attended eight
    straight seasons, including this past February at seven months pregnant!
- question: Tell us how you've been styling your precious baby bump.
  answer: It's not easy! I've been very lucky to have a comfortable pregnancy, so
    I've mostly been focused on tighter clothes that show off my bump! It's funny,
    but clothes that I would have shied away from pre-pregnancy – body-con dresses,
    tight tanks and sweaters – are now my wardrobe staples!
- question: Are you planning to pass your fashion-savvy ways on to your little one?
  answer: I hope so! We're having a boy, so I'm constantly saving boy inspiration
    photos for his future style!
- question: You wrote a book! What was that process like?
  answer: Long and grueling! I've actually written three novels that are all part
    of a series, and it's been an incredible challenge but also extremely rewarding.
    After several years and hundreds of pages, the characters are like my best friends!
- question: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
  answer: Easy and elegant. I like to keep my outfits comfortable and wearable, but
    still embrace my favorite trends. And I love a great high-low mix – you'll see
    me pairing Chanel with T.J. Maxx or Forever 21 constantly!
- question: Do you prefer delicate or statement making accessories?
  answer: Both! I love delicate pieces, but I tend to always gravitate to statement
    accessories.
- question: Neutrals or bold hues?
  answer: Bold colors!
- question: What is one item in your wardrobe that you could never replace?
  answer: The pearl and diamond earring that my mother had custom made for me as my
    wedding present, that I wore on our wedding day. I only break them out for special
    occasions, but they're incredibly special to me.
- question: How difficult was it to get your blog up and running in the beginning?
  answer: It was difficult, but I was so obsessed with it that it hardly felt like
    work! I was thrilled for every small milestone and victory, from my first email
    from a reader to my first NYFW invitation!
- question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
  answer: Be true to yourself, live honestly and compassionately, and the rest will
    flow from there. Focus on the journey and not the reward and you'll always be
    satisfied where you are.
- question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers interested in fashion and food?
  answer: Blogging takes a lot of hard work and dedication, but it's also the best
    job you can ever have! Pick something you're passionate about and even hard work
    will feel like fun.

(and remember, you met her first on Blogspotter!)_

**Tell us about your self-titled blog, Melanee Shale.** My blog is a look into my daily outfits where I love to incorporate current trends with pieces that I adore whether they are old or new. I also inspire girls to create outfits on a budget because there are many girls out there just like me who can’t always afford designers clothes. I want them to know that it's okay! You can still look amazing by getting creative. Shop affordably then mix and match your old and new clothes. It works! Occasionally, I like to incorporate posts about events I’m hosting or attended, giveaways, and new items that my readers need to try.

**You’re so beautiful! And you look so happy in all of your posts. You obviously love blogging. What gives you inspiration for your content?** Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I only just recently realized that I love to smile in my pictures. I was so serious for awhile. My photographer friend, Ryan Chua really helped to bring it out of me and now I just can’t stop smiling! What inspires me for my content is knowing that I have the chance to inspire other girls through my outfits and through my writing. Also, looking at other blogger posts through Instagram really inspires and challenges me to come up with real original content.

**What other blogs/websites do you follow?** My favorite blogger has always been Julie from Sincerely Jules. I can definitely relate to her California cool casual style. Her photos are always amazing as well. She’s my biggest inspiration. I also keep up with the latest fashion trends by reading Lucky Magazine online and I love Pop Sugar Fashion.

**If you were to wear one outfit everyday for the rest of the year, what would it be, and why?** I've been on a realistic binge lately. I've realized that running around Los Angeles everyday takes an enormous amount of effort. So dressing up in high heels and a skirt isn’t going to cut it. Jeans, a cropped tank, a leather jacket, boots and a beanie does.

**Quick question: what's your favorite color?** Black!

**Pearl studs or diamond studs?** I wear my diamond studs that my mom gave me as a gift years ago literally every day.

**Who is your favorite designer? (or favorite designers)** Marissa Webb, Rebecca Minkoff, Thakoon, Alexander McQueen and Chanel.

**Instagram or twitter?** Instagram now and forever!

**If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?** I actually wouldn't have done anything differently since I began blogging. It's been great since the beginning and I wouldn’t change a thing.

**If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?** Remember to always love yourself and who you are cause if you don't, who will? Don’t change for anyone!

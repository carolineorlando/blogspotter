interview:
- question: Tell us about the The Moptop.
  answer: The Moptop is my fashion blog that I started my senior year of high school
    after stumbling upon Free People. I was so inspired by their website and blog
    that I decided to make one of my own!
- question: The name is so interesting! How did you come up with it?
  answer: I’m a huge fan of The Beatles and my hair is always kind of messy and curly,
    so I thought The Moptop would be the perfect name!
- question: How long have you been blogging for? Do you blog full time?
  answer: I started my blog December of 2010. I blog as often as I can with school
    and work. I hope to someday blog full time.
- question: We love your long, dark hair. How easy is it to maintain your easy-going
    look?
  answer: Thanks! My hair is naturally curly so I think that helps some. But I curl
    the top pieces that are kind of flat. I don’t brush my hair too often, which sounds
    weird but I think this helps is stay kind of messy and wavy.
- question: What brought you to the world of blogging?
  answer: It was definitely seeing Free People's blog and discovering all these people
    with blogs too. I never knew this was a thing, but I was so inspired by there
    creativity and outfits that I wanted to be a part of it.
- question: Who are a few of your favorite designers?
  answer: I don't really follow high fashion too religiously, which I should probably
    start doing. But I am always wowed by Anna Sui and Dolce and Gabbana.
- question: What inspires your personal style on a daily basis?
  answer: My style icon, Alexa Chung, is always a great inspiration for me. As well
    as icons of the 60s such as Anna Karina and Bob Dylan. I love the classic styles
    of the past.
- question: What blogs do you frequent?
  answer: Flashes of Style is one of my favorites, I've been following Bonnie's blog
    for a long time and I love how consistent she is with her style and vintage aesthetic.
    I also love Natalie Off Duty and Kelli Murray.
- question: If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one pieces from one designer,
    who would it be?
  answer: That's a hard one. Can I just replace my whole wardrobe with Alexa Chung's
    closet? :)
- question: Gray or grey?
  answer: Black.
- question: What is it that makes your blog unique and different from others?
  answer: I really try to pick backgrounds that work with my outfit. I try to pick
    different locations rather than just always standing in front of the same wall
    or space. It's almost like a photo shoot every time I take photos for my blog,
    I really want to work with the feel/vibe of the outfit.
- question: Who takes your photos? And what camera do you use? Do you have any tips
    for taking great photos?
  answer: I usually take the photos myself with my tripod. I have a Canon Rebel t2i
    and I’m hoping to get a new lens soon! My advice would be just take your time,
    photography takes practice!
- question: If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would
    it be?
  answer: Obviously, first and for most, be true to yourself! I feel as though people
    really appreciate reading authentic blogs, it's more interesting. And also, have
    fun! Try not and take it too seriously all the time... I need to work on that
    one too!

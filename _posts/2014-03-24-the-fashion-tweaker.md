interview:
- question: First of all, your blog is SO FUN. How do you convey so much vivaciousness
    in all your posts?
  answer: Hahaha! Why thank you! Honestly, it's not something I try to do, I guess
    it just happens because that's who I am. I've been told that I have a big, bright,
    colorful personality and apparently it comes through in my photos!
- question: How long have you been blogging and why did you start?
  answer: My sister and I started a popular cocktail blog called Fashionably Bombed
    in 2010. After a few years and a good amount of success (we actually have a book
    coming out in June called &#8220;Candy Cocktails&#8221;!) we wanted to try starting
    our own individual blogs. I started Fashion Tweaker in November of 2013 because
    if I could, I would spend all day, every day, playing in my closet!
- question: How did you come up with the name for your blog?
  answer: Whenever I buy something I inevitably end up tweaking it in some way- I’ll
    change the buttons, make it more fitted, add a belt, raise or lower the hem, etc...
    so it seemed like the perfect name. Plus there's the whole double entendre- fashion
    being my drug of choice!
- question: What made you choose the color scheme and graphics?
  answer: It seems like I always want everything to be bigger, brighter, shinier and
    more intense! You can often her me saying, &#8220;Does it come in a brighter color?&#8221;
    So I thought the hot pink and red stripes outlined in gold glitter did the job...
    but oh no, that wasn’t enough, I had to add tons of shiny gold curly ribbon to
    the background!
- question: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
  answer: Bright, colorful & fun! I like pattern and texture and fitted silhouettes.
- question: Who are some of your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?
  answer: Kate Spade, J.Crew, Trina Turk, Lilly Pulitzer because, like me, they are
    not afraid of color!
- question: Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore
    other aspects of the industry?
  answer: Yes! Growing up, whenever I complained about not having anything to wear,
    instead of whisking me off to the mall to go shopping, my mom would say,  &#8220;Well
    you better get creative! &#8220; Although I HATED when she said that, I think
    that's where my love of fashion and my ability to put outfits together comes from.
    I would spend hours in my closet  &#8220;getting creative &#8221; and I still
    do! As for the other aspects of the industry, I am open to it all!
- question: What is your main source of style inspiration?
  answer: Everything around me! Recently I've been inspired by the turquoise and pink
    floral wallpaper in my bathroom, the leopard hats of former African dictator Mobutu,
    the architecture of Palm Springs...
- question: What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?
  answer: ALL OF THEM! The brighter the better! You will almost never find me wearing
    black. I love patterns too! Stripes, polka-dots, plaid, florals, gingham, etc...
- question: How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile
    endeavor?
  answer: Blogging has been the perfect way to express my creativity and connect with
    other creative people. A worthwhile endeavor? Oh hell yes!
- question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
  answer: I always thought that amazing things happened to people because they got
    lucky. I imagined that one minute they were sitting on the couch watching TV and
    the next minute they were popping champagne because they got their own TV show
    deal! I never knew how much work went into making those things happen. Blogging
    has taught me that if you are consistent and patient those amazing things will
    SLOWLY start to come to you.
- question: About how long does an average blog post take?
  answer: It’s hard to say because when I'm working on my blog I'm having so much
    that I don't pay attention to the clock! From photo shoots to graphic design,
    I would say a few hours, at least.
- question: Do you have help taking your photographs, or do you do them yourself?
  answer: Because I already had a few years of blogging experience behind me before
    I started Fashion Tweaker, I knew how important high quality, professional looking
    photographs were. I hired a professional photographer from the very beginning.
    It has definitely been a wise investment!
- question: What plans do you have for the future of your blog?
  answer: All of them!
- question: Any advice for bloggers wanting to create a space as bright and welcoming
    as yours?
  answer: Yes! Stop talking, start doing!

_Her snapshots are styled to perfection - with outfits that are always on point. From statement necklaces to ladylike dresses, **Kendall Johnson** of **Styled Snapshots** shows you how to pull if off. She works with children and dabbles in photography, all while living in the big apple with her man and adorable pup. We are crushing even harder on Kendall's style now that we know more about it, and her!_

**We love your style so much! Tell us how you got started with blogging.** After years of spending countless hours scrolling through other blogs, I decided it was time to start one of my own. I wanted a place that allowed my creative juices to flow and express myself in a way that positively impacts others. I love mixing high-end with lower-end pieces, and encouraging others to think outside the box when it comes to their wardrobe.

**The name "Styled Snapshots" flows so well off the tongue. How did you come up with it?** To be honest, the reason it took me so long to start my blog is that I could not think of the perfect name. I always loved taking pictures that capture a perfect moment, especially with fashion and one day it just came to me... Styled Snapshots!

**How do you balance a full-time job and part-time blogging? Any rules of time management that you live by?** It took me awhile to get into the swing of things, and I am still figuring out what works best for me. At first I would stay up late into the night trying to get by on a couple hours of sleep each day, and rush home from work to try and snap a picture before dark.

I realized quickly I had to create a schedule and utilize as much of the weekend as possible. Scheduling posts ahead of time has been the light at the end of the tunnel. Also, keeping a notebook to jot down ideas constantly. Some of my best ideas have come to me in the most obscure places.

**Let’s get into style. Your outfits always incorporate a punchy pop of color. If there was only one color in the world to accent your outfits with, what would it be - and why?** This is a tough one! I would have to say a bright pink, whether it be your lip color or a statement necklace, that is a color that catches your eye and adds the perfect punch to any look.

**What's your favorite must-wear accessory right now?** Pave link bracelet, hands down! I pair it with a cluster of bracelets or let it shine on its own, but it adds a fun pop to any outfit.

**Fashion Week was just here! Were you super excited about any designers in particular?** This was actually my first Fashion Week experience and I was fortunate enough to attend the Jay Godfrey presentation. His fall collection is effortlessly translates the 70’s rock and roll spirit into edgy prints and rich textures. From a sequined hoodie to a two tier bubble skirt, I left there wanting it all.

**Are there any blogs that you follow on a daily basis? Do they provide you with inspiration, or do you find that living in New York City gives you inspiration in itself?** There are a handful of blogs that I have followed all along in which inspired me to start my own: Gal Meets Glam, Atlantic-Pacific, Pink Peonies and Happily Grey. I have to say though, every day I walk out onto the streets of New York I am inspired by all that surrounds me and it truly is a city where you can try any fashion trend or risk and get away with it.

**If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?** Thailand! My boyfriend and I have been bit by the travel bug and this is next on our list. We are that couple that starts talking about their next trip the second they get back from the last. It doesn’t hurt to think about somewhere warm since we have had a brutally cold winter!

**If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one piece from one designer, who would it be?** Rebecca Taylor - Her collections are always effortlessly chic, polished and classic while always adding an extra detail of texture or prints to stand out amongst the rest.

**Red matte lips or nude shiny gloss?** Red matte lips! NARS "Heatwave" is a staple in my bag!

**Street coffee or Starbucks?** I know, I know, I should pick street coffee since I am a New Yorker, but I can’t let go of my Starbucks... Grande Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte please!

**Chunky or dainty jewelry?** The chunkier the better.

**Where do you see Styled Snapshots in 3 years?** I hope that it is a site that people wake up and want to check first thing in the morning to gain daily inspiration. I want to continue to grow and build my platform to encourage others that it is ok to mix polkadots and stripes, and you can find a great piece at Forever21 and pair it with something designer to create that perfect look. I want to be able to share my everyday findings with the world and never give up on my dream of one day sitting front row at New York Fashion Week.

**What's one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?** The biggest this I learned is that it truly is a 24/7 job, my brain never stops thinking, but it’s a 24/7 job I absolutely love and would never change. Also, the incredible friendships I have formed and how supportive fellow bloggers are of each other.

**If your sister was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of advice you would give her?** Buckle up, it is a life changing journey that I would never trade anything for. Stay true to yourself and as cheesy as the saying goes, if you love what you do, you will continue to do it and never stop.

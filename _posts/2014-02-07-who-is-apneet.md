interview:
- question: You’ve switched up your focus quite a bit! You used to blog over at Fabric
    Snob. Why don’t you tell us a little bit about why you made the move over to your
    self-titled blog &#8220;Who is Apneet?&#8221;
  answer: I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="//fabricsnobblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/editors-letter-introducing.html">detailed
    Editor's Letter</a> about the change over at FS, but the short story is that I've
    outgrown the site. The name is very fashion-centric, and I would like to explore
    more and express more beyond just clothing. The goal at Who is Apneet? is daily
    blogging, forcing me to constantly be writing, taking photos, taking in experiences
    and sharing. Aiming to develop a new post every day is really helping me stretch
    my creative muscles. There’s still a fashion focus on Who is Apneet? but I'm also
    working on print projects, some exciting fashion collaborations, zines, and so
    much more!
- question: Did you study fashion formally as an undergraduate?
  answer: I'm actually an undergrad here in NYC and I'm majoring in Music, with a
    concentration in Flute. I also served as an editor at our college newspaper for
    three semesters.
- question: Who takes your photos? They're just beautiful.
  answer: Aww shucks, I wish I could say I had a photographer but most of the time
    it's just myself, my tripod, and a camera remote. If someone else shot a blog
    post, I always leave a credit.
- question: Your posts ooze with color. We can't stop staring. What gives you inspiration
    on a daily basis?
  answer: Thank you! I'm inspired largely by my surroundings, the outside world wether
    it be the ocean or city buildings. I love color and texture, shapes and silhouettes.
    I'm also inspired by music, my favorite authors, and pretty much anything French.
- question: What are you wearing right now?
  answer: My favorite thing to wear right now is this oversized 90's Walmart sweater
    (yes, really) that's completely falling apart. I got it years ago from a friend
    of mine and it’s been passed around our circle of friends many times. It's my
    turn to wear it again.
- question: Quick&#058; List the first 5 adjectives that come to mind when you think
    of your blog.
  answer: Adventurous, whimsical, fresh, daring, and humorous.
- question: You're a Brooklynite. Have you always lived in Brooklyn? Does NYC generally
    have a strong influence on your style?
  answer: I'm from the fairer coast! I grew up in the Bay Area, California, and moved
    to NYC in 2008 to attend college. Going from a season-less environment to four
    distinct weather periods has definitely influenced my style! The biggest thing
    I learned, out of necessity, is that layering is my friend.
- question: What's your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps
    you with branding your blog? If so, in what way?
  answer: I think I enjoy Instagram the most. It's a great way to connect with my
    readers, and share with them little snaps in real time.
- question: Where do you see yourself in a year? 3 years?
  answer: I don't often think about long-term planning... my goals and ideals change
    every other week so I have no idea! There are so many avenues I’ve paced down
    that there’s no telling where I'll be or what I'll be doing there, and that in
    itself is most exciting.
- question: Taking into consideration the experience you've garnered over the past
    few years, what's one piece of essential advice you'd give to an aspiring blogger.
  answer: I would say &#8220;be yourself.&#8221; It sounds lame but it’s really the
    best thing. Find your own voice and MAKE YOUR OWN RULES!

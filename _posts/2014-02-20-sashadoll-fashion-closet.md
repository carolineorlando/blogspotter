interview:
- question: Tell us a little bit about SashaDoll Fashion Closet - where did the name
    come from?
  answer: My nickname in my language is Sasha and my family calls me doll. So I thought
    it sounded cute SashaDoll. Then I just played around with words and came up with
    SashaDoll Fashion Closet.
- question: How long have you been blogging for?
  answer: I started in June of 2013. Still fairly a newbie!
- question: When did you make the decision to launch your own blog? Did you just have
    an &#8220;ahha&#8221; moment, or did something else motivate you to take the leap?
  answer: I have been thinking about it for a long time. I love fashion blogs and
    always wanted to have one of my own. I often get stopped on the street by girls
    and women to ask me where I got something or to compliment me. I love sharing
    my cheap finds (read inexpensive not cheap looking) with everyone. I thought blogging
    about it would also be a great way to do that. If nothing, at least I will have
    a diary of outfits in case I have one of those days when I don't have any inspiration
    of what to wear, haha. Once I verbalized it out loud, it had to happen.
- question: You work in the financial industry but you pose like a pro! Do you have
    any prior fashion industry experience?
  answer: None at all. But thank you for the compliment. If you look at my pictures
    in the beginning you will notice that I wore a lot of sunglasses, I was very shy
    and uncomfortable in front of the camera (even though it is mostly my husband
    taking pictures), but over time I worked through my fears and got better at it.
    Once you learn to relax in front of the camera you become yourself, which is the
    most beautiful you. You just have to find poses that work for your body shape.
    Practicing in front of mirror helps but camera sees you differently through the
    lens. So practice by taking pictures.
- question: You move around a lot. Where are you from originally? Do you find a lot
    of inspiration in your hometown?
  answer: I was born in Sarajevo. When the war started I moved and lived in Belgrade,
    Serbia. I also moved several times in Canada too and now finally (I hope), I am
    settled in Toronto. I definitely think that my style is influenced by where I
    am from. I get a lot of feminine inspiration from Serbia (or region in general).
    Being dressed up at any time of the day, wearing heels even in icy weather, I
    think comes from my roots. The casual, more urban vibe a lot of my outfits have,
    is definitely influenced by the culture and my life in Canada. I believe it to
    be a great mix.
- question: You wear color so well. Any tips for pulling off brights/neons?
  answer: Make sure you pick the shade that works for your skin tone. There may be
    different shades of neon pink, or yellow, or any other neon colour out there,
    and you can find the one right for you. If you really don’t feel that any of them
    go very well with your skin tone, then wear it away from your face. Wear the colour
    in skirts, pants, accessories. Most people look great in bright colours. We just
    have to get over the fear that we may stand out too much. You look brighter and
    happier in happy colours and for sure you leave others feeling that way too.
- question: Do you have a favorite accessory in your closet?
  answer: It used to be my XL hoop earrings. Now I am not sure. Do shoes count?
- question: QUICK! Who is your favorite designer?
  answer: Shoes&#058; Sophia Webster. Clothes&#058; Dolce & Gabbana (especially their
    last collection) and Zara. I have also fallen in love with Peter Pilotto! Amazing
    prints and shapes!
- question: Jewel tones or neutrals?
  answer: I love colour so jewel tones.
- question: Black or navy?
  answer: Oh that’s hard. I'll go with black.
- question: Latte or cappuccino?
  answer: Espresso, haha! Ok, cappuccino it is.
- question: What are your thoughts on blazers?
  answer: I am a huge fan. Even though I have a hard time finding ones that fit my
    body shape, I love them. You can dress them up or down, wear them over dresses.
    They are one of those pieces of clothing in your closet that will be used over
    and over again. It is a must for any woman. You should have at least three&#058;
    at least one black one, one in either navy, gray, white or tan colour (second
    neutral) and one in a bright colour.
- question: How are you feeling about the &#8220;Statement Piece&#8221; (jewelry)
    trend?
  answer: I love jewellery in general. You can spruce up any outfit by adding one
    of those amazing statement necklaces or bracelets. In the summer especially, I
    love to wear a plain t-shirt, heels, jeans and to dress it up, I add statement
    necklace. If you don't feel like dressing up too much but still want to look like
    you put some effort into it, this is a great way to do it. Also, if you are not
    feeling great about your body and want the attention at your face, what a better
    way to do it then to put on some great earrings or a necklace.
- question: Do you find that social media has been an important factor with respect
    to your blog's growth?
  answer: I'm still learning about it. But I can definitely say that it is a huge
    part of being a blogger.
- question: What's the coolest thing that's happened to you since you started blogging?
  answer: There has to be a few. Definitely being approached for collaboration is
    a compliment, but receiving kind emails and notes from people all over the world,
    is more important. I also got to speak (email) with some of my favourite bloggers
    who have answered many of my questions when I was just starting. It was great
    to see that someone famous who receives hundreds of emails and messages daily,
    took the time to answer my questions and send me off with kind words into the
    blogosphere.

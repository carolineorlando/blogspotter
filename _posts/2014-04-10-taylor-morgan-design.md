interview:
- question: How long have you been blogging and what made you start?
  answer: I have been blogging since the end of 2009. I started so that I could share
    my journey of going after my dream to start my brand Taylor Morgan. I wanted to
    share the ups and the downs to show the reality of making your dreams come true.
    And by doing so, I hoped that I would also inspire others to go after their own
    dreams, whatever they may be.
- question: How did you decide what you wanted to post about?
  answer: I just post what makes sense for me at the time. In the beginning it was
    a lot about my bridal line I use to do. Now I have moved on from bridal and am
    working as a designer at Tommy Hilfiger. Now I like to share things I love, whether
    it is my own street style, home decor I love, or this great city I call home!
    At the end of the day, this blog is my journey or journal if you will. The end
    goal is to launch my brand Taylor Morgan and I want people to see my journey to
    getting there. Every once in a while I throw in a little about my work life. Unfortunately
    I can't share to much about what I do at Tommy. But I still like to remind my
    readers that I do work as a fashion designer.
- quesiton: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
  answer: Classic. I love feminine dresses and skirts. Very ladylike. But I also have
    a casual side to me. I am not big on following trends, I just do my own thing.
- question: Has living in NYC shaped your style at all?
  answer: 100%! I feel like NYC helped give me style! There is something about living
    here that inspires you. There is such a good energy here and some of the best
    dressed people live here and that all rubs off on you in a good way!
- quesiton: Where are some of your favorite places to shop in the city?
  answer: I wish I could tell you that I go to unique one of a kind boutiques. But
    I don't. I am just like any other girl who loves Madewell, Zara and J.Crew.
- question: Who are your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?
  answer: I love so many designers for so many different reasons. But at the top of
    my list is Valentino. I love him for not only his work but who he is as a person.
    He is amazing! All designers inspire me because they have made their brands happen.
    And I plan to do the same!
- question: What is your main source of style inspiration?
  answer: Street style. I love just what I see on the streets day to day in the city.
    And also online from other bloggers. I like street style the most because it's
    the reality of what people are actually wearing. I like to take that and work
    backwards into designing. I feel it helps you be a better designer cause you are
    truly designing for the everyday person, not just a magazine shoot or runway.
- question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
  answer: Black skinny jeans and a good chambray button up.
- question: What are some of your go-to colors and patterns to wear?
  answer: Black and white are always my go to colors. I love plaids and leopard for
    patterns.
- question: Is there a certain piece or look that feels very you?
  answer: Anything black and white! Feminine dresses feel very "me".
- question: About how long does an average blog post take?
  answer: It depends on what kind of blog post it is. But I would say about an hour
    on average.
- question: Do you take your own photos or do you have help?
  answer: My sweet husband James takes all my photos for me. I edit them myself on
    my computer.
- question: What have you learned through starting and maintaining a blog?
  answer: It is a lot of work! It truly could be a full time job when done right.
    It takes a lot of patience and consistency. But it is very rewarding! You meet
    lots of great people and companies through it. And it is a great creative outlet!
- question: If you could start your blogging journey all over again, would you change
    anything?
  answer: Sure I would. But it is what it is. You get better as you go. There are
    lots of old post I look at and cringe, but it's where I was at at that time. I
    am sure I will feel the same about my current content in five years. But that's
    part of the deal! At least its honest and real. So you can't ever regret that.
- question: Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?
  answer: Be yourself and don't get caught up in the blogging world. Blogging is great!
    But there is a side of it where you see lots of "fashion bloggers" blogging to
    become "famous bloggers." Sure they can have success, but the content doesn't
    feel genuine. People connect most to reality. So, just be who you are and don't
    try to change yourself or wardrobe for your blog. I relate more to the blogger
    who shops at Forever 21 than the one with a Celine bag, Louboutin shoes and a
    $600+ outfit on. That's not reality for most people. People love real people,
    so just be you!

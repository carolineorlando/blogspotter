interview:
- question: How did you break into blogging?
  answer: I started like most fashion bloggers, as a follower of some really great
    blogs and it transitioned into a desire for a creative outlet. I studied History
    of Art which is really theoretical, so I wanted to do something practical like
    styling.
- question: How long have you been blogging for?
  answer: The Haute Heel is three years old, I started it during my first summer of
    university.
- question: Do you blog full-time, or is it just a hobby right now?
  answer: It's a hobby that I really enjoy. I try to prioritize it whenever I have
    the free time but I have a full time job now that I have graduated.
- question: You've switched up your style quite a bit. What was the reason for the
    shift?
  answer: Part of it came with a huge lifestyle change. Moving to Singapore from London
    meant a lot of alterations to my style and wardrobe. I started with purging colour
    from my new purchases, everything was white, black, grey or red. Now I am more
    settled in my new city I feel as if a return to colour is due.
- question: We all know the saying&#058; a photo speaks a thousand words. What's the
    key to taking a good photo?
  answer: I take photos as part of my job now, so I always say great lighting and
    knowing how to smile. A lot of people find smiling really awkward (me in particular)
    because I had monstrous teeth and braces as a child. My friends always tease me
    because I look really serious in my blog photos.
- question: Does living in London (a fashion mecca!) have a huge impact on your personal
    style?
  answer: I was in London for eighteen years and it definitely did. Even the type
    of designers I was drawn to influenced my style. I loved layers, nudes, sparkly
    and sheer things as well as very classic cuts. London has a great sense of individualism
    and the best shopping ever, so I was never really hesitant to try out new combinations
    or looks.
- question: What are a few of your favorite blogs? Where do you look for inspiration?
  answer: I am totally in love with Jessica Stein of Tuula's style. I am addicted
    to Instagram for my fashion inspiration, it has a great sense of real- time and
    really represents the zeitgeist of youth.
- question: Nail polish&#058; what is your safety it-always-works color? (Brand? Color
    name?)
  answer: Deborah Lippmann has really beautiful and unique colours but right now I
    am all about the nudes. Their shade 'Naked' is my staple favourite. As for manicures,
    soft gel is the only way to go. I love a good French manicure so for DIY, Incoco
    do the best nail foils that last for two weeks and actually strengthened my nails.
- question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
  answer: Living in another city, reunited with my dog Gatsby, and my boyfriend.
- question: If your best friend was about to start her own fashion blog, what would
    be one piece of must-have advice you'd give her?
  answer: I have always told my friends, if you are going to start, don’t give up
    after two months.

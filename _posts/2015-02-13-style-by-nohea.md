interview:
  - question: We love your blog! Tell us a little bit about Style By Nohea.
    answer: It started as a blog just about my personal style and fashion advice, but has turned into a blog about everything I love - fashion, beauty, travel, home, cooking.
  - question: Your name is beautiful! What does it mean?
    answer: Thanks! It means 'beautiful heavenly gift' in Hawaiian.
  - question: When did you officially start blogging, and what was it that made you want to start?
    answer: I started my blog in late 2011 because everyone always asks me for fashion advice, so I decided to share my advice with the world.
  - question: You blog about fashion, beauty, and lifestyle - what's your favorite thing to blog about, and why?
    answer: This is tough, but fashion. I get a LOT of commentary from people saying that I’ve inspired them in the fashion realm because I’m not stick thin. These comments mean SO much to me and really keep me going knowing that there are people out there that are inspired by me.
  - question: Do you frequent any websites for daily inspiration? What are they?
    answer: I definitely frequent Instagram 24/7 for inspiration.
  - question: Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?
    answer: I have my artsy friends take my photos because they understand me and my blog the most... I've tried different photographers, but they can’t seem to capture what I want and my friends seem to do it the best! I usually repay them with a treat to happy hour... I really do have the best friends. I have a Canon Rebel and I'm experimenting with different lenses... right now I have a 50mm.
  - question: Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?
    answer: Yes, I’ve always been interested in fashion! I used to want to be a designer but then I took a sewing class and quickly found out that I sucked at sewing. But I am a graphic designer and digital marketer and hope to carry out my talents in the fashion industry.
  - question: How would you describe your personal style?
    answer: Feminine with an edgy and grungy twist.
  - question: QUICK! Polka dots or stripes?
    answer: Stripes, duh.
  - question: Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial?
    answer: Social media is 100% crucial for blogging. Without it, I know that my blog would not have reached the level it's at today. The social media platform definitely depends on the type of blog. For fashion or travel it would be Instagram, beauty would be YouTube, and lifestyle would be really any social platform.
  - question: What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?
    answer: Probably being able to work with huge brands like Piperlime, ShopBop, SexyHair, Neutrogena, and a lot more. I was also just brought on as a contributor to AOL's StyleList! These types of things really keep me going.
  - question: QUICK! Gold accents or silver accents?
    answer: All gold errthang.
  - question: What’s one thing that blogging has taught you?
    answer: To not be afraid of what people think about me. I have some people laughing at me and some people telling me that I’ve inspired them to start their own blogs and businesses or simply made them feel good about themselves. The people that enjoy my blog are the reason why I do it... imagine what kind of inspiration I would be if I quit because of the people that laugh at me?
  - question: If your best friend decided to launch her own blog, what piece of advice would you give her?
    answer: To not aim for perfection. Blogging is a learning process. You will not know everything when you first start, and no one expects you to. Just learn as you go and don’t freak out if things aren’t perfect or if things aren’t going the way you planned.

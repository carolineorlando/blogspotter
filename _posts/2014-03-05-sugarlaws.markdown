_A southern belle and soon-to-be mommy, **Katy Atlas** of **Sugarlaws** is the sweetest. Her expert ensembles and cheerful color choices are her blog's main course, while must-try recipes and helpful everyday tips are served for dessert. She has documented her personal style throughout her pregnancy and will undoubtedly pass plenty of fashion wisdom on to her little one. Oh, and her posts are so well-worded for a reason, because she's also written a book! Peek into Katy's full life and learn more about Sugar Laws with Blogspotter._

**Why is your blog called Sugarlaws? Does it have to do with your sweet tooth?** Sugarlaws actually started as a food and recipe blog for the first year and a half! I added fashion in 2009, so people sometimes forget that it was about food before it was about fashion!

**You blog about food and style. Why did you decide to cover both topics on one blog?** Food and fashion are two huge loves of mine, and I couldn't imagine my life without either! Both food and fashion are about making life beautiful, happy and comfortable – or as I like to say, living sweetly!

**How long have you been blogging and why did you start?** I've been blogging since 2008, which is about a century in internet-years! I started Sugarlaws as a way to keep track of all the new recipes I was making in my tiny Manhattan kitchen, but it soon became a way to chronicle the last five years of my life.

**Tell us about the experience of attending New York Fashion Week.** Fashion Week is always such a blast! It's so incredibly inspiring to see all the hard work and effort come together on the runways, and to get a sense of the styles we'll all be drooling over in the coming year. I've attended eight straight seasons, including this past February at seven months pregnant!

**Tell us how you've been styling your precious baby bump.** It's not easy! I've been very lucky to have a comfortable pregnancy, so I've mostly been focused on tighter clothes that show off my bump! It's funny, but clothes that I would have shied away from pre-pregnancy – body-con dresses, tight tanks and sweaters – are now my wardrobe staples!

**Are you planning to pass your fashion-savvy ways on to your little one?** I hope so! We're having a boy, so I'm constantly saving boy inspiration photos for his future style!

**You wrote a book! What was that process like?** Long and grueling! I've actually written three novels that are all part of a series, and it's been an incredible challenge but also extremely rewarding. After several years and hundreds of pages, the characters are like my best friends!

**Give us a brief description of your personal style.** Easy and elegant. I like to keep my outfits comfortable and wearable, but still embrace my favorite trends. And I love a great high-low mix – you'll see me pairing Chanel with T.J. Maxx or Forever 21 constantly!

**Do you prefer delicate or statement making accessories?** Both! I love delicate pieces, but I tend to always gravitate to statement accessories.

**Neutrals or bold hues?** Bold colors!

**What is one item in your wardrobe that you could never replace?** The pearl and diamond earring that my mother had custom made for me as my wedding present, that I wore on our wedding day. I only break them out for special occasions, but they're incredibly special to me.

**How difficult was it to get your blog up and running in the beginning?** It was difficult, but I was so obsessed with it that it hardly felt like work! I was thrilled for every small milestone and victory, from my first email from a reader to my first NYFW invitation!

**What main message would you like to convey to your readers?** Be true to yourself, live honestly and compassionately, and the rest will flow from there. Focus on the journey and not the reward and you'll always be satisfied where you are.

**Any advice for aspiring bloggers interested in fashion and food?** Blogging takes a lot of hard work and dedication, but it's also the best job you can ever have! Pick something you're passionate about and even hard work will feel like fun.

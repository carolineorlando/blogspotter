_**Natasha Bernard** of **Fashionably Fabulous** believes that there is no right or wrong in fashion and being passionate is the key to success. Sewing and thrifting are among some of the passions she blogs about, giving her personal style a uniquely creative spin. A combination of modern vintage, sophisticated and urban, Natasha's looks are all about variety. For all things Fashionably Fab, read on about Natasha's blogging journey._

**How long have you been blogging and what made you start?** Fashionably Fabulous came to fruition in October, 2013. I initially started blogging for my online store but decided to blog on a personal level as a way to document and share my love for fashion through sewing, thrifting and writing about all things fashionably fabulous.

**How did you decide on a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?** The design concept for the blog was originally established when my online jewelry store was created. I wanted to keep a cohesive look among the two.

**Why did you choose your tagline, "Be bold. Be fabulous. Be you!"?** It is a true reflection of who I am and the message that I want to convey to my readers. My fashion choices are certainly bold. There is no secret that I am a risk taker. Fashion is most certainly about dressing up and feeling fabulous all while remaining true to you.

**Give us a brief description of your personal style.** I would say that my personal style is a combination of modern vintage, sophisticated chic and urban. You will more than likely see bold colors and prints reflected heavily. It’s my signature.

**How do you choose outfits worthy of posting?** I try to keep variety in mind. So when I decide on posting a look, I always keep the previous look in mind. Variety is the spice of life.

**Does knowing how to sew play into your outfit choices?** Yes. Most certainly. I spend a lot to time, money and effort sewing so the clothes that I make are not for practice only. I make them to be worn. Whenever I’m feeling like wearing a one-of-a-kind, I turn to garments that I’ve made.

**Do you tend to gravitate toward neutrals or bright hues?** Bright hues most certainly. I have a love affair with bold colors and prints. I think they complement my complexion well. They also play a positive part in my mood and psyche.

**Does your Tampa, Florida location inspire your looks?** Hmmm. To some degree. Florida in general plays a part. It’s always sunny here for the most part, so nothing compliments sunshine and palm trees like color.

**What is your main source of style inspiration?** I look to fashion magazines and fellow bloggers for style inspiration.

**Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?** Those comfy boyfriend jeans.

**What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?** It has taught me that passion is key. If you are passionate about the topic at hand, it will show and your readership will grow over time.

**What is the coolest thing that's happened since you started?** Hearing from my readers that I have inspired them in some shape, form or fashion has been so cool and rewarding.

**If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?** I wouldn’t change anything. It’s been a great ride.

**What main message would you like to convey to your readers?** I would like to convey that there is no right or wrong in fashion. Great style isn't only reserved for those with access to high-end luxury. It's ultimately about a creative sense that comes from within; while keeping an open mind for inspiration. It can come from some of the most unexpected places.

_Don't be fooled. **Antiques & Coffee** is not solely about antiques and coffee. It is also a record of the eclectic personal style of **Sally-Jean White**. One day she might take inspiration from the 50s and next she'll borrow from the boys. When it comes to designers, though, she believes in girl power, citing Rebecca Minkoff as a favorite. Keep up with Sallie's ever-changing looks and learn more about her with Blogspotter below._

**Tell us about Antiques & Coffee.** Antiques & Coffee is just a little ol' blog I started to share my love of fashion, all things vintage and DIY projects. I always look to awesome antique pieces and loads of coffee to stay inspired... See what I did there?

**When did you launch Antiques & Coffee, and how long have you been blogging for?** Antiques & Coffee originally began about 2 years ago, but I didn't begin to actively blog till almost a year ago when I discovered that it's such a great way to express myself creatively.

**How would you describe your personal style?** I would definitely describe my personal style as eclectic. One day I want to dress like I live in the '50s and another day I may want to dress like a girl who stole her boyfriend’s clothes (which I actually do!) I've always felt that if you want to wear something, you should wear it and rock it!

**You must love coffee... considering it’s half of the name of your blog! So we must ask: how do you take it? Black, cream, milk, sugar...** Coffee is life! Ha-ha! I usually take my coffee with hazelnut creamer and sugar, but I love to mix it up and use coconut oil as a sweetener! Yum!

**What's your take on social media? How has social media generally helped with the branding of your blog?** Social media has really allowed me to get my blog out there. While I'm still consistently working to grow A & C, social media is helping me to share my blog and make new friends in the blogosphere.

**Do you find that social media is the reason for a lot of your traffic, or is your traffic driven from other bloggers/organically?** I'd probably have to say that the blogger community has really welcomed me with open arms. For such a long time, other bloggers were my only source of traffic because I never shared my blog for fear of seeming "braggy", #introvertproblems. Yet now that I've come out of my shell, I'd definitely say that social media is such a good way to network and grow your traffic.

**If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?** Oh my, well, if I could afford to... I would say Fossil. Gorgeous watches, cute handbags and classic clothes!

**Generally speaking, what's your favorite thing about blogging?** Being someone who hates to take directions when it comes to creativity (I hated art classes in school) the freedom of blogging about whatever you want is my favorite thing by far. I can blog about DIY beauty products one day and a rad new thrift shop the next. With blogging, the possibilities are endless.

**QUICK! Spicy or sweet?** Spicy, hands down! Major chips and salsa addict over here!

**Who are your 3 favorite designers?** Rebecca Minkoff, Kate Spade, and Victoria Beckham! Girl power!

**Did you study fashion as an undergrad? If not, how are you able to implement what you studied as an undergrad into the operation/content of your blog?** I'm actually still an undergrad working toward my B.S. in Business Management (only 3 more months!) Essentially, I've learned how to really manage my blog and I work toward treating it like my own business. One day, I hope to channel everything I've learned into a real business that incorporates things I love!

**Do you have a favorite social media platform? For personal and business purposes, which is it and why?** I'd have to say Instagram is my favorite. I think it really let's you see people’s creative sides and who doesn't love a good selfie?

**QUICK! Tell us one really cool thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging.** This! My journey with blogging has just begun but as I become more and more involved with the blogging community, I love it even more than before! Things like this help me to remember that even though it can get hectic, it's still so fun!

**If you had to offer one piece of essential advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be?** Just keep blogging! In the beginning, you may think to yourself, "this stuff I'm making/writing/doing isn't good!" but everyone sucks at first and you'll get better! When it comes to blogging, I try to live by these two quotes: "Don’t compare your beginning to someone else's middle" and "The expert in anything was once a beginner." If you keep to it, you won't regret it!

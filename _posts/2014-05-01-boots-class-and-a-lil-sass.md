- question: Tell us a little bit about yourself and your blog, "Boots Class & A Lil
    Sass" (cutest name, ever!)
  answer: Thank you! Well I'm from a small town in Wyoming; I have always had a passion
    for fashion. I would constantly go to the local grocery store to buy magazines
    (the closest 'city' was 2 hours away) so I would find anyway to stay up-to-date
    on the latest fashion & beauty trends. Then I went to become a cosmetologist &
    makeup artist, dashed in with a few other professions. The Boots Class & A lil
    Sass came from my LOVE for cowboy boots, a reminder to always be classy & a maybe
    just a little bit sassy... but always in a cute fun way!
- question: You're absolutely stunning - and we love your golden-girl-meets-sassy-chic
    style. What made you want to start blogging?
  answer: Awe well thank you so much! Well I started my blog more as a self-expression
    and I wanted to share my love for fashion & beauty with others. If I could give
    any fashion inspiration to anyone or any makeup tips & someone benefited from
    them, it makes it all worthwhile!
- question: You have such an interesting background! How do you balance everything
    so well? Any tips regarding time management?
  answer: If it's important to you, you will make time. I grew up with a dad who is
    such an incredibly hard worker & I rarely saw him complain. He managed his time
    by making what he did a priority. I guess I picked that up & it motivated me use
    my time wisely.
- question: Your outfits always incorporate flowing long blonde hair and bold accessory
    accents. If you only had one must-wear accessory in your closet, what would it
    be - and why?
  answer: My bracelet stacks, for sure. They can be dressed up or dressed down. A
    good set of bracelets go with anything!
- question: Where did you grow up? Does location heavily influence your style?
  answer: Star Valley, Wyoming. Absolutely, my favorite outfits reflect from being
    from Wyoming. A little western-rustic-casual vibe is my fave!
- question: What quote or mantra do you live by?
  answer: '... "The only person I''m trying to be better than is the person I was
    yesterday." It''s important to only be in competition with yourself, and to push
    yourself everyday to be a better person. Also it''s incredibly important to ALWAYS
    be yourself - everyone else is already taken.'
- question: What websites or blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?
  answer: I love ModaMob.com, Polyvore, Pinterest of course, & following tons of style
    bloggers|stores on instagram!
- question: If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?
  answer: Turks & Caicos
- question: If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life,
    what would it be?
  answer: Crisp white tee, distressed cut offs, cowboy boots or converse, killer bracelet
    stacks, long stacked dainty necklaces
- question: Glitter or sequins?
  answer: Sequins
- question: A pop of pink or yellow?
  answer: This is tricky... pink!
- question: Metallic or matte?
  answer: Matte
- question: Do you ever reach out to other bloggers for advice or networking? Have
    you made blogger friends in the industry? If so, how did you go about doing that?
  answer: When I first started out, I reached out to a few bloggers (some who never
    responded) but I didn't get discouraged, the ones who did were so nice & helpful.
    Most bloggers have a 'contact me' on their site so it made it easy to shoot a
    message and get some advice.
- question: What's your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps
    you with branding Boots Class & A Lil Sass?
  answer: Instagram and Pinterest by far! Yes - absolutely it helps!
- question: What's one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect
    to learn?
  answer: How much work goes into a blog and building up your site. The time that
    is put in to making it reflect who you are as a blogger and a person. The importance
    of details and making sure you never lose sight of who you are and the reason
    why you started blogging.
- question: If your best friend was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow,
    what's one piece of must-have advice you would give her?
  answer: To not give up, it doesn't matter how many readers you have as long as you
    are fulfilling what you set out to do with your blog. If you stay true to yourself
    and the blog you poured your heart into, it will pay off. When you receive that
    first email or comment from someone asking how you did your hair or where you
    got that certain accessory or any advice, I promise you will get such a sense
    of reassurance and pride in what you're doing. It makes it that much more meaningful.
    Xoxo babes!

And sassy is OK, as long as it's mixed with an equal part of classy. Meet the stunning blonde behind Boots Class & A lil Sass with Blogspotter today.

interview:
- question: We recently came across Blush and Blonde and fell in love. It's so American,
    graced by an American beauty! Tell us a little about your blog and the concept
    behind it.
  answer: Gosh now I'm literally blushing! Thanks y'all! I started Blush and Blonde
    as a way to express myself and have a space of my own, so to speak. As an Army
    wife, my time and decisions are never really my own... There's very little that
    I get to control in terms of where I live and what I do professionally. My childhood
    dreams of moving to NYC to work in fashion were no longer realistic, so I had
    to make my own creative fashion outlet! It's already been more rewarding than
    I could have imagined, it takes real entrepreneurial spirit and being able to
    directly see the fruits of your labor is immensely gratifying.
- question: How long have you been blogging for?
  answer: Not long! I finally got the courage to start it at the end of 2013, although
    I'd been playing with the idea for quite a while.
- question: How did you know it was the right time to launch your blog? Did you just
    go with a gut instinct, or had you gathered a little experience through other
    creative outlets first?
  answer: I just went for it and jumped in with both feet. It’'s very much been a
    learn-as-I-go process. No guts no glory!
- question: Where did you get the name &#8220;Blush and Blonde&#8221; from?
  answer: I played around with name ideas for a while. I literally just wandered around
    the house saying random words that described me/my style aloud. Blush is my favorite
    color and my blonde hair is my trademark (which can be both good and bad!). I
    liked the alliteration of the two so I immediately checked to see if the domain
    name and social media handles were available. Luckily the name Blush and Blonde
    hadn't been taken anywhere so I knew it was perfect! I'm the kind of person that
    just couldn't stand to have different variations of it or random numbers added...
    I'm kind of OCD.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: There are a lot of words that I would use to describe my personal style...
    Classic, modest, preppy, generally understated. When I get dressed I like to feel
    ladylike. Despite what people say, you often DO judge a book by its cover. I would
    rather my cover read Gone With the Wind than Fifty Shades of Grey.
- question: Do you have a favorite brand?
  answer: Just one? Oh gosh. Probably Lilly Pulitzer. The attention to detail never
    ceases to amaze me and I've never put on a Lilly that didn't fit like a glove.
- question: Where are you from originally? You’re in California now, do you find that
    being in California has influenced your personal style drastically from what it
    was?
  answer: My family is originally from the South and when I was young I spent a lot
    of time in both California and Georgia. I went to college in the San Francisco
    Bay Area, but moved back to Georgia right after graduating. I think that wherever
    I am, my personal style stays the same. I know what I like and I know what I feel
    good in. Sometimes I stick out like a sore thumb here in California, but that's
    ok by me because I feel confident in what I wear. I was working in the news for
    a while, and I remember one day I came into work and one of my coworkers bluntly
    announced that my outfit made me look like a Southern housewife. To this day I'm
    really not sure if that was meant as a compliment or an insult, but it’s fine
    by me either way! To me, it was a compliment.
- question: Do you blog full-time? If not, do you have any times on part-time blogging
    and time management?
  answer: Yes, I blog full-time. I had no idea that it really was such a full-time
    pursuit before I began. On most days, I spend way longer than a 9 to 5 period
    on my blog. Between creating content, planning, managing social media, interacting
    with readers and working with or reaching out to brands, I'm swamped! Time management
    has definitely been a struggle. The solution for me has been to write everything
    down in a planner and prioritize. Never underestimate the power of a good list.
- question: How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start
    to finish, including &#8220;thinking&#8221;, photography, editing, and content
    writing)
  answer: The entire process of a single blog post usually takes a few days, sometimes
    longer. For me, it's a little bit harder because my husband takes my pictures
    and his schedule is always changing. On average I'd say it takes 4 days. Planning
    and writing are the easiest for me, photography and editing are always time consuming.
    It's always good to have some other ideas up your sleeve that don’t involve your
    own pictures or outfits. Sometimes I'll do wish lists, collages, or good recipes.
- question: QUICK! Pink or red?
  answer: Pink, duh! Is that even a question?!
- question: QUICK! Diamonds or pearls?
  answer: Pearls! But I'll never say no to diamonds either.
- question: QUICK! Large floral print or jumbo polkadot print?
  answer: Oooh this one's a little harder. Depends on my mood, but I'd probably be
    more likely to go with the floral.
- question: What's one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect
    to learn?
  answer: That I can do a lot! A blog is essentially a publication, and I'm the writer,
    editor, creative director, model, photographer, chef, and IT support all rolled
    into one. I didn't know I could do any of those things, let alone all of them!
    It's very motivational.
- question: Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?
  answer: My sweet husband takes my pictures! But bless his heart, he is a soldier
    and NOT a photographer! I always have this artistic vision in my head that he
    has a bit of a hard time translating. I love him to death for all the time and
    patience he's spent helping me though. My next step is to reach out to some local
    photographers who might be willing to shoot with me in exchange for exposure on
    the blog. I have a Nikon D3200, which is a great DSLR for a decent price. I think
    that quality images are something that sets really good blogs apart, so a good
    camera is an important investment. I've learned that the secret is in the lens
    though! The quality of your image will often depend on whether or not you have
    the correct lens for what you’re shooting. I currently have the standard 18-55mm
    telephoto lens and a 50mm prime lens, which are great to start with. My next purchase
    will be the 135mm, which should produce better full-body fashion shots. I would
    advise other new bloggers to take some time to study and learn about photography,
    you'll be glad you did!
- question: If you were to offer advice to an aspiring blogger that you wish you had
    received, what would it be?
  answer: The advice I'd give to a new fashion blogger is the same advice I'd give
    to anyone&#058; stop worrying about what you think people want to see. Stop worrying
    about what someone else says is &#8220;trendy.&#8221; You run your own blog...
    your style IS the &#8220;it&#8221; style here. The readers who like your style
    and are inspired by it will find you and they'll be faithful readers as long as
    you stay true to what you actually believe.

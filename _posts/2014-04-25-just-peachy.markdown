_**Rachel Regal** of **Just Peachy** started by keeping a quote journal in the form of a blog. Instead of writing about how a quote inspires her, she now shows us her daily inspirations. From home decor to outfit choices to favorite products, Just Peachy is a peek into Rachel's peachy Georgia life. Learn more about her and her blogging journey through her Blogspotter questionnaire._

**How long have you been blogging?** I've been blogging since I was a Junior in college – so 4 years now! But I took a year off when I graduated so I consider it about 3 years total.

**Why did you start Just Peachy?** I originally started Just Peachy as a quote journal where I would post a quote, then right a little paragraph about how it applied to my life. This blog exists no longer, but it was my entry into the blog world. When I saw how many other people were sharing their lives I thought – this is cool, I can do this too!

**How did you come up with the name for your blog?** I'm from Georgia, so that makes me a Georgia Peach – hence the peachy. And I have a pretty optimistic outlook on life so everything is always "just peachy!"

**When you started Just Peachy, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?** When I first started, I shared a whole lot more of my personal life and what I was doing every weekend. Since I was in college and in a sorority, I always had something going on. And when I started that's what most blogs were about – just life and what was happening. Then when I graduated from college, I started working and didn’t have a lot of time to blog and I definitely wasn’t as social as I was in college so it kind of evolved into just fashion and what I like to shop for.

**Have you always been interested in clothing, shopping and styling?** Always! When I was younger I would dress up my sister in different outfits and take pictures of her like mini photo shoots. But I was also a huge tomboy up until I moved to Georgia – as in only Nike, Adidas and sweatpants and tennis shoes to school. I was at the mall every weekend in middle school and was nominated for best dressed in high school! I also won a fashion marketing competition in high school and I minored in fashion merchandising in college. When I graduated, I went on to become the Marketing Manager for a popular chain of boutiques. So yes, my whole life has involved fashion!

**Would you like to explore any other aspects of the fashion industry?** I've been in Fashion Marketing professionally and that's a huge passion of mine, but I really want to be in styling. I want to be able to go out and shop for a client and be her fashion guardian angel! I love putting outfits together and giving advice for what to wear.

**How would you describe your personal style?** Such a hard question! I don’t really have a name for it. It's like preppy-hipster-chic. I like pieces that I can wear to all kinds of events and I'm also very casual. I don't like stilettos but I love wedges and I love oversized tees and skinny jeans.

**Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?** J.Crew and Madewell hands down. I'd say 85% of my closet is from these 2 stores. Granted, I used to work at J.Crew so it holds a special place in my heart. Plus, J.Crew is my workday saving grace. I would wear plain black slacks and a white blouse to work every day if it weren’t for J.Crew. I love the easy, casual, tomboy-ish charm of Madewell and that’s my weekend wear.

**What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?** My favorite colors to wear are black, gray, blue, and coral. I have way too many striped shirts. I also love embroidered Aztec pieces – they’re my weakness!

**Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?** Chambray shirt, striped tee, black skinnies, and my Tory Burch flats.

**How do you decide which outfits are post-worthy?** If it's something that I know others will wear, I'll post it, especially if there’s something a little different about it like camo with hot pink and heels or florals with stripes. I tend to post only what I think is wearable for many people and with pieces that are easy to find or recreate.

**About how long does an average blog post take?** An average blog post takes about an hour to take, but an outfit post will take much longer. Between getting ready, getting dressed, taking the photos, and writing about it I would say it takes about 3 hours! It’s definitely not a spur of the moment decision to take an outfit post.

**Do you take your own photos, or do you have help? What kind of camera do you recommend?** I take my own photos with a DSLR, tripod, and remote. I wish I had someone to take all my photos! It's especially embarrassing when someone walks up on you taking pictures of yourself... I recently upgraded from the Nikon D40 to the Canon Rebel T3i and I am obsessed. I definitely recommend the Canon!

**What main message would you like Just Peachy to convey to your readers?** That clothes are fun, they show your personality, and you can look cute putting basics together in a fresh way! I want to my outfits to be wearable so that other readers can relate to me or get outfit ideas!

**Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?** Just have fun with it. Don't go into it with the goal of being "famous" or making money – then it will feel like a chore and you won't make friends. That’s my second piece of advice – make friends! Follow tons of people on Twitter and Instagram and talk to them! I've made some of my best friends through blogging.

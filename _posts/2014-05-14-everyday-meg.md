interview:
  - question: How long have you been blogging?
    answer: I’ve been blogging consistently for 2.5 years.
  - question: Why did you start Everyday Meg?
    answer: I had started a blog in college to chronicle my adventures in student teaching, but I soon realized that the stories I had to write weren’t exactly Internet appropriate I put the blog on the backburner. I picked it back up in the Fall of 2010 when I accepted my first job teaching in a town of 956 people it was basically the only way I could interact with anyone above the age of 12 and below the age of 60!
  - question: When you started your blog, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?
    answer: When I started Everyday Meg I had no plan, no vision, no real purpose. It has evolved into so much more than I could have ever dreamed!
  - question: About how long does an average blog post take?
    answer: Between photos and editing and content I spend anywhere between 1.5-2 hours per post!
  - question: How did you come up with the name for your blog and your tagline "snap, sparkle, savor"?
    answer: The name I originally started this blog under wasn’t my favorite and as I began to explore what I wanted out of blogging I realized that I wanted people to be able to do "Everyday Life" with me, so Everyday Meg it was! Being an English teacher I have a thing for alliteration so I knew that I wanted to incorporate the three of my favorite things in a catchy way!
  - question: As a teacher by day and photographer by night, how do you also find time to blog?
    answer: I make time. Honestly, it is the most cathartic thing I do all day. I ALWAYS feel better after I hit the publish button.
  - question: Why did you want to blog about fashion, food, and photography?
    answer: Those are the three things I go to bed thinking of and what get me out of that same bed in the morning. I don’t see fashion as just clothes I see it as a reflection of a person’s soul. I don’t see food as just fuel I see it as a person’s heart on a plate (oh what imagery there!) and I see photography as a way to capture both of those things in a silent still moment.
  - question: How would you describe your personal style?
    answer: Evolving. One of my favorite stories to tell is of a 13 year old male student who just couldn’t wrap his head around my style. One day he finally had had it and blurts out in the middle of class "CAN'T YOU JUST PICK ONE TYPE OF STYLE PLEASE — one day you're all preppy and the next you look like a hippie so weird." So I'm going to say evolving - I'll stick with evolving.
  - question: Does your teacher wear differ much from other outfit choices?
    answer: I am pretty frugal, so if I can throw a cardigan or a pair of tights on with an outfit to wear to school it is a keeper. Some of my favorite outfits have either been "school" outfits that have gotten adapted for "real" life or vice versa!
  - question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
    answer: A good tailored blazer and a white t-shirt (and earrings, can I add jewelry? Because I don’t go ANYWHERE without earrings). They are quintessential transition pieces! They can transition any outfit from season to season or day to night!
  - question: What is your favorite subject to post about and why?
    answer: I love doing “anti-tutorials”, the basic idea is saying, "Hey ya'll, I'm Meg and I have no idea what I am doing and make a lot of mistakes, but you can totally learn from me!"
  - question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
    answer: Starting a blog has taught me that opportunities are everywhere. It is easy to get pulled in a million different directions and to lose your way but staying true to yourself is the only way you can be happy.
  - question: What is the coolest thing that's happened since you started?
    answer: Hands down (Dashboard confessional Anyone?), it has been meeting some of the most inspirational women on this planet. Many of them have become my close personal friends. In fact, I was just a bridesmaid in a blog friends wedding.
  - question: If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?
    answer: Oh, this one is tough. I would love to be all "No Regrets y'all" but there are several posts and silly things I did at the beginning of blogging that weren't really me... so I would be lying if I said "no regrets" but I do feel like I have learned from all those experiences to become the blogger I am today.
  - question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
    answer: Do something different. In a world where it is increasingly harder to be an individual do things because you want to do them not because everyone else is! In other words... you do you!

interview:
- question: Turquoise and Teale is part of the Southern Blog Society. How does southern
    style play a big part in your posts?
  answer: Southern style has always been a part of my life. Growing up in Georgia
    you're surrounded by quintessential southern charm; bright colors, bold prints,
    beautiful oak trees and some of the most welcoming people you'll ever meet. My
    posts are a mixture of all my favorite things&#058; classic styles, beautiful
    images and food that you can throw together for anything from a Sunday brunch
    to an al fresco dinner party.
- question: You share not only personal style, but also cooking, travel, and other
    interesting snapshots of your life. What made you want to cover so much in your
    blog?
  answer: Before I started Turquoise & Teale I found myself drawn to blogs that covered
    a variety of things they were passionate about. The writing seems to connect most
    with me when bloggers are sharing what they love and providing an assortment of
    posts. What better way to represent myself than include a little of everything
    that I love? Think of it as a one-stop-shop! You can find new beauty products,
    a dessert recipe and a splash of fashion all in one place.
- question: How do you manage bouncing around from Atlanta, Georgia to Charleston,
    South Carolina to Saint Louis, Missouri?
  answer: Staying organized while traveling is key. It's embarrassing how much I rely
    on a calendar to keep me on top of events/deadlines/meetings, but it's what works.
    Safe to say there's rarely a dull moment when you're always on the go!
- question: You probably have your packing and travel style down pat. Tell us about
    your process.
  answer: If I was ever on a TV show and asked my special talent, it would easily
    be packing a carry-on, TSA approved suitcase in under 5 minutes. My foolproof
    method starts with lining the suitcase sides with shoes and roll everything else
    that's going in. Start with the heaviest items (jeans, jackets) on the bottom
    and work your way to lighter fabrics. Store jewelry in a clutch and always have
    a light scarf with you — you're bound to need it for something!
- question: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
  answer: My personal style could best be described as classic and preppy with a modern
    twist. I love finding pieces that can be worn running around town during the day,
    but also could be dressed up for drinks at night. For accessories I like to keep
    things simple. I'll find a delicate gold necklace, bangles and a great watch and
    wear them non-stop; those are the pieces to invest in and never go out of style.
- question: You mention that the best color combination is navy and white. How did
    you come to this conclusion?
  answer: For me a combination of navy and white instantly reminds me of something
    fresh yet bold. I haven't met a single person that doesn't look good in those
    two colors... it's magic and flatters everyone! To me, it's timeless.
- question: Are there any other color or texture combinations that are close to your
    heart?
  answer: As a graduate of University of Georgia, black and red will always remain
    close to my heart. Come Saturdays in the fall, there's a 99% chance I'm wearing
    the combo and cheering on the bulldogs with a cocktail in hand.
- question: Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?
  answer: Some of my favorite places to shop are the little tucked away stores that
    are off the beaten path. Charleston has some amazing shops scattered around the
    downtown peninsula and I love finding little local made treasures. For clothing,
    I could easily live in J.Crew, Zara and Shopbop.
- question: What items in your wardrobe could you never live without?
  answer: My engagement ring, a comfortable and chic pair of flats and a great leather
    bag that withstands the test of time.
- question: Where do you hunt for the clothing and products that you are &#8220;currently
    loving&#8221;?
  answer: For my &#8220;Currently Loving&#8221; series, I start out by browsing the
    sites that I normally visit on my own. If there's a new product that I'm using
    and loving, that goes into the mix too! I aim to keep a mix of price ranges in
    the post so there's a little something for everyone. Finding something that catches
    your eye and realizing it's affordable, that’s what I love searching for.
- question: Who or what is your main source of style inspiration?
  answer: My main source of inspiration is all around me. I'm constantly being inspired
    by magazines, other bloggers and people walking down the street.
- question: What made you start blogging in the beginning?
  answer: In the beginning I started blogging to keep my family and friends in the
    loop when I moved away to Charleston, SC. They were always asking for new recipes
    and favorite new finds, so I combined it all into one easy spot for them.
- question: How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile
    endeavor?
  answer: I've absolutely loved blogging and all the opportunities it's given me.
    I've met some wonderful friends while traveling, learned tips and tricks from
    readers around the world and created an online scrapbook of sorts that lets me
    relive some of my favorite moments along the way.
- question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
  answer: The main message that I would hope to convey to readers is that I'm a down
    to earth, mid-twenty year old girl that loves writing and sharing what I'm passionate
    about. I'm not perfect, life's not perfect, but I love expressing myself through
    my blog and having the readers to follow along wherever life takes me.
- question: Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?
  answer: Write about what excites you, support other bloggers and never compare yourself.
    Don't feel like you have to post every day. Skip a Wednesday post if it means
    spending extra time with your girlfriends at happy hour or enjoying the company
    of family. Take time to really live life and the joy will show through in your
    writing.

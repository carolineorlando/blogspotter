interview:
  - question: Wow. So My Style Vita has grown so much since we first stumbled across your blog a year or two ago. Do spill! When did you start (exactly) and how did you get to where you are now?
    answer: I started officially in April of 2011 (wow just realized it was 2011, so long ago!) to have a writing portfolio. I do have to admit I wasn't a real deal fashion blogger until mid-2012. I feel like I got a super slow start to it since I had no idea what a blog was when I began. I'd have to say I got to where I am now through consistency, staying true to who I am, partnering with great bloggers and brands and interacting with them on social.
  - question: Has social media played an important role in the growth of My Style Vita?
    answer: Social media is imperative to the success of your blog. The majority of my traffic outside of direct referrals is Twitter (my favorite) so it’s essential to stay on top of it, interact and create great content for my readers.
  - question: You're also involved with Southern Blog Society. How did you get into that?
    answer: I found it super hard to find other bloggers to meet with, chat with, and become friendly with here in Atlanta. I stumbled onto Poor Little It Girl's twitter one day and thought I’d shoot her an email since she also lived in Atlanta and seemed to be doing the same thing I was. We instantly clicked and became blogging buds, but after a few months we started talking about how the community needs, well, a community! It shouldn’t have been so hard for us to find each other and from there we developed Southern Blog Society. We joke that it’s like the match.com for blogger friends. I've met so many great people through it and actually see them face to face which is important for building relationships.
  - question: What gives you inspiration for your content?
    answer: My everyday life encourages me to create content. I want to find more fun hairstyles to try, so I search for hair inspiration photos and voila, a new beauty post is born. I also love putting outfits together so that’s always fun to do and easy to create content for the site.
  - question: Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have a favorite blog?
    answer: There’s so many, I have to say Krystal Bick’s This Time Tomorrow was a first of mine that I fell in love with and I think her outfits and closet are just stunning. Kendi Everyday is also a favorite (another first). A few recent obsessions are A Little Dash Of Darling and A House In The Hills.
  - question: You cover a few topics on your blog. What’s your favorite to write about, and why?
    answer: I think it’ll always be fashion, but I love branching out with the recipe posts. They allow for more personal stories as outfit posts can sometimes be a little dull sometimes unless there’s a good anecdote for the outfit.
  - question: What was it that made you want to get into blogging originally? Did you have an &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moment, were you inspired by something, or did you just want to try it out?
    answer: I wanted to build a writing portfolio and had no idea this world even existed. My passion is to write and when someone recommended blogging (my blogging cousin over at The Zhush) I said why not. After a few months I realized I could write the way I want to do it and make it a side job, it was just perfect.
  - question: What’s been your favorite personal look published on My Style Vita thus far? Why?
    answer: That’s a tough one! I think there’s been several, but recently the black Lulu’s jumpsuit was a favorite. I think because my hair and makeup looked so fierce (it was the day I cut bangs for the first time in 3 years) and it just worked.
  - question: Mint chocolate chip ice cream or strawberry?
    answer: Mint chocolate chip. With extra chocolate sprinkles on top.
  - question: Cats or dogs?
    answer: Dogs, I’m actually a little scared of cats.
  - question: Embroidery or embossing?
    answer: Embossing, but I prefer to be boring and leave things as is.
  - question: If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging&#058; what would it be, and why?
    answer: I would’ve done more research on blog design and I would’ve gotten me s**t together sooner. I had no idea that you could buy a premade layout and for $30 you can have a beautiful blog. If you saw my blog in the first 6 months, you would totally laugh at me. Horrible! I think now that blogging is becoming so mainstream, these resources are more available, so who knows if that even existed almost 3 years ago.
  - question: You’ve had immense success since you hit the ground with My Style Vita - and now Southern Blog Society. If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?
    answer: Network, network, network. Since we started SBS, I’ve learned that networking and building relationships is vital to the success of your business in any industry. I still have work to do with that, my blog and SBS. Always room for growth, learning and expansion!

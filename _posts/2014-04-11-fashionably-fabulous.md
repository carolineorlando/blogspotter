interview:
  - question: How long have you been blogging and what made you start?
    answer: Fashionably Fabulous came to fruition in October, 2013. I initially started blogging for my online store but decided to blog on a personal level as a way to document and share my love for fashion through sewing, thrifting and writing about all things fashionably fabulous.
  - question: How did you decide on a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?
    answer: The design concept for the blog was originally established when my online jewelry store was created. I wanted to keep a cohesive look among the two.
  - question: Why did you choose your tagline, "Be bold. Be fabulous. Be you!"?
    answer: It is a true reflection of who I am and the message that I want to convey to my readers. My fashion choices are certainly bold. There is no secret that I am a risk taker. Fashion is most certainly about dressing up and feeling fabulous all while remaining true to you.
  - question: Give us a brief description of your personal style.
    answer: I would say that my personal style is a combination of modern vintage, sophisticated chic and urban. You will more than likely see bold colors and prints reflected heavily. It’s my signature.
  - question: How do you choose outfits worthy of posting?
    answer: I try to keep variety in mind. So when I decide on posting a look, I always keep the previous look in mind. Variety is the spice of life.
  - question: Does knowing how to sew play into your outfit choices?
    answer: Yes. Most certainly. I spend a lot to time, money and effort sewing so the clothes that I make are not for practice only. I make them to be worn. Whenever I’m feeling like wearing a one-of-a-kind, I turn to garments that I’ve made.
  - question: Do you tend to gravitate toward neutrals or bright hues?
    answer: Bright hues most certainly. I have a love affair with bold colors and prints. I think they complement my complexion well. They also play a positive part in my mood and psyche.
  - question: Does your Tampa, Florida location inspire your looks?
    answer: Hmmm. To some degree. Florida in general plays a part. It’s always sunny here for the most part, so nothing compliments sunshine and palm trees like color.
  - question: What is your main source of style inspiration?
    answer: I look to fashion magazines and fellow bloggers for style inspiration.
  - question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
    answer: Those comfy boyfriend jeans.
  - question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
    answer: It has taught me that passion is key. If you are passionate about the topic at hand, it will show and your readership will grow over time.
  - question: What is the coolest thing that's happened since you started?
    answer: Hearing from my readers that I have inspired them in some shape, form or fashion has been so cool and rewarding.
  - question: If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?
    answer: I wouldn’t change anything. It’s been a great ride.
  - question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
    answer: I would like to convey that there is no right or wrong in fashion. Great style isn't only reserved for those with access to high-end luxury. It's ultimately about a creative sense that comes from within; while keeping an open mind for inspiration. It can come from some of the most unexpected places.

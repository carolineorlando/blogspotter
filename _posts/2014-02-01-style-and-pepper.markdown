_"Who says it's bad luck to spill the style?" is the trendy tagline of the fabulous **Style & Pepper**. Almost as creative as its name, this site features a fashionista who is just as chic: **Jessie Artigue** is a stylist, fashion blogger, and creative consultant, cooly representing fashion as a part of her modish New York lifestyle-and what better place to do so than in one of the greatest fashion capitals of the world. Her blog offers insight into her own personal style, provides fun DIY projects, and cleverly connects fashion and food. Jessie even gives readers a peek into her closet and shows off amazing pieces, while generously offering the opportunity to purchase some of her own clothing and accessories, all for reasonable prices._

**What's the inspiration for Style and Pepper?** I find inspiration in so many places, from movies and tv shows, to other bloggers, to pop culture and current events... I'm always keeping my eyes peeled and "pinning" things that I love to remember for later.

**What are some of your favorite things about your blog?** I love that I place a very high focus on a budget-friendly wardrobe.  I think it's proof that you can look great for not a ton of money, and unless people read the notations in my outfit posts, they never know the difference!

**Who are some of your favorite designers/brands?** My first answer to this question isnâ€™t really a brand, but I will always choose vintage above all else.  As far as designers go, I love Marni, Suno, Alexander Wang & Erin Fetherston, just to name a few.

**What kind of advice can you give to aspiring bloggers?** Figure out how to blog about what you love and then put your own twist on it that no-one else could replicate. A unique edge and genuine voice are the most important. Also, don't undervalue your influence and go with your gut instinct when it comes to working with site sponsors!

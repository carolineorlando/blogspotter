**Tell us about the The Moptop.** The Moptop is my fashion blog that I started my senior year of high school after stumbling upon Free People. I was so inspired by their website and blog that I decided to make one of my own!

**The name is so interesting! How did you come up with it?** I’m a huge fan of The Beatles and my hair is always kind of messy and curly, so I thought The Moptop would be the perfect name!

**How long have you been blogging for? Do you blog full time?** I started my blog December of 2010. I blog as often as I can with school and work. I hope to someday blog full time.

**We love your long, dark hair. How easy is it to maintain your easy-going look?** Thanks! My hair is naturally curly so I think that helps some. But I curl the top pieces that are kind of flat. I don’t brush my hair too often, which sounds weird but I think this helps is stay kind of messy and wavy.

**What brought you to the world of blogging?** It was definitely seeing Free People's blog and discovering all these people with blogs too. I never knew this was a thing, but I was so inspired by there creativity and outfits that I wanted to be a part of it.

**Who are a few of your favorite designers?** I don't really follow high fashion too religiously, which I should probably start doing. But I am always wowed by Anna Sui and Dolce and Gabbana.

**What inspires your personal style on a daily basis?** My style icon, Alexa Chung, is always a great inspiration for me. As well as icons of the 60s such as Anna Karina and Bob Dylan. I love the classic styles of the past.

**What blogs do you frequent?** Flashes of Style is one of my favorites, I've been following Bonnie's blog for a long time and I love how consistent she is with her style and vintage aesthetic. I also love Natalie Off Duty and Kelli Murray.

**If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one pieces from one designer, who would it be?** That's a hard one. Can I just replace my whole wardrobe with Alexa Chung's closet? :)

**Gray or grey?** Black.

**What is it that makes your blog unique and different from others?** I really try to pick backgrounds that work with my outfit. I try to pick different locations rather than just always standing in front of the same wall or space. It's almost like a photo shoot every time I take photos for my blog, I really want to work with the feel/vibe of the outfit.

**Who takes your photos? And what camera do you use? Do you have any tips for taking great photos?** I usually take the photos myself with my tripod. I have a Canon Rebel t2i and I’m hoping to get a new lens soon! My advice would be just take your time, photography takes practice!

**If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?** Obviously, first and for most, be true to yourself! I feel as though people really appreciate reading authentic blogs, it's more interesting. And also, have fun! Try not and take it too seriously all the time... I need to work on that one too!

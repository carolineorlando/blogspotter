interview:
- question: Tell us about your blog!
  answer: Moeh Fashion started as a personal project. I had just started college,
    and being that I attend FIT, I knew I would be networking with a lot of people
    in the fashion industry and I really wanted some sort of portfolio that I could
    give. My blog started out as just that, and as I was experimenting with posts
    I realized how much I enjoyed blogging. I started sharing my personal style, photography,
    any collaborations and work I was doing.
- question: Where did you get the name from?
  answer: The name was inspired by 2 things. Mo, in a very informal way, means more.
    Since I knew I wasn't the first to be sharing personal style on the web, I felt
    I was just sharing more fashion. I then took the spelling of my best friends moms
    name, Moeh, who had inspired me in my younger fashion years and combined it with
    the idea of more fashion. Hence, Moeh Fashion.
- question: What is your favorite part of blogging?
  answer: My favorite part about blogging is exploring to find good places to shoot.
    My blog gives me a reason to get out and see new places with friends or visit
    usual spots just for fun. It also keeps me motivated, busy, and always on my toes
    with new ideas.
- question: What other blogs/websites do you read?
  answer: I get most of my daily reads from Facebook, Twitter, and/or Pinterest. Refinery29
    is one of my favorite websites to browse for news and fashion. It's very easy
    to get lost in their website which is why I enjoy it so much.
- question: How do you get your inspiration?
  answer: A lot of my inspiration has come from Pinterest. It's been a platform that
    allows me to gather all of the ideas and things I like including more than just
    outfits. I find my inspiration comes from seeing style in all fields such as interiors,
    food, travel, beauty, as well as fashion.
- question: How has blogging changed your outlook on fashion and personal style?
  answer: I think the whole concept took me by surprise. The opportunities for bloggers
    in the industry right now are definitely pretty amazing. It's also very inspiring
    to be able to inspire others with everyday looks. Many people can't take a high-end
    magazine and replicate what they like into to real life fashion. Personal style
    bloggers make that much easier for their followers. I think it also goes to show
    how much opportunity there is in fashion in general. Opinions are everything in
    this industry, express yours on the Internet and you may be sitting front row
    at next fashion week.
- question: What are some of your favorite designers/brands?
  answer: I love discovering new and smaller brands. I am currently in Australia,
    and discovering Aussie brands has been a lot of fun. A few I love are Seafolly
    Australia, Mode Collective, and Zimmermann.
- question: How would you describe your style?
  answer: I laugh because if I were asked this questions 3 years ago my answer would've
    been extremely different. There's something amazing about growing up and the changes
    a person can go through mentally as well as physically. I love being able to look
    at my old posts, when I was wearing chunky rings and chunky platform heels on
    a daily basis. Now I resort to basics, denim and a lot of black. I prefer a minimal
    and mature look at the moment and I feel a lot more comfortable being in something
    practical, minimal, yet stylish.
- question: What is your first memory of fashion?
  answer: My first fashion memory definitely had to have been trying on all of my
    older sisters clothing. I remember I used to be so upset because nothing fit me.
    I was too small to wear "big girl" clothing and I couldn't wait until I could
    get their hand-me downs.
- question: Favorite fashion quote or motto?
  answer: This doesn’t have much to do with fashion but it's one of my favorite quotes,
    and filed under
- question: What is the key to having a good sense of style?
  answer: The best way to having a good sense of style is being aware of what works
    for your body and then stick with it.
- question: Quick, think of your wardrobe (however big it may be!). What's your favorite
    garment?
  answer: A vintage oversized black/navy blazer that originally had long sleeves and
    shoulder pads so big you can easily be confused with a football player. I decided
    to chop off the sleeves and take out the pads, and now I have a very structured
    and long blazer vest. It is the perfect layering piece for both summer and winter.
    I wear it over jackets, under jackets, by itself, and just about everything else
    possible.
- question: What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?
  answer: I find a lot of people think having a blog is easy, but they don’t realize
    how time consuming the process can be until they begin and fail. My advice is
    if this is truly your passion, or hobby then it is an amazing way to create and
    share your content, meet new people, and potentially start your own business.
    It’s been an amazing journey!

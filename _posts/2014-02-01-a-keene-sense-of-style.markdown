_**Elizabeth Keene** is the blogger behind **A Keene Sense of Style**, a definite go-to for lady-like chic. Whether she's wearing a structured blazer or a pencil skirt, Keene's look is always polished, put-together and of course never boring. You can always spot a pop of color and an eye-catching print. She draws style inspiration from socialite Olivia Palermo and Hollywood starlets like Zoe Saldana, Emma Stone and Cate Blanchett, starlets known for their chic and elegant style. Read on to find out her number one style tip and what items are on her must-have list!_

**Who are some of your celebrity style icons?** My celebrity style icons are Olivia Palermo, Zoe Saldana, Cate Blanchett and Emma Stone has been looking so fabulous lately, she’s a new fave.

**Where are your favorite places to shop?** I adore thrift stores and consignment shops because you never know what you’re going to find, it's like digging for treasures! Also I love Zara, ASOS, J Crew, and H&M.

**How would you describe your style?** My style is best described as structured feminine. I love clean lines and ladylike silhouettes. I sometimes look back at my blog posts and realize that I have worn skirts or dress for 10 days straight! I don't know how it happens, but I feel best when I am wearing something feminine. It makes me feel more confident and put together.

**What are your must-have items?** A structured top handle tote, the perfect shade of red lipstick, cuticle oil, SPF 50+ moisturizer, a great fitting pair of jeans, nude pointy toe pumps, sparkly shoes, and big glamorous studs.

**What do you love most about fashion?** What I love most about fashion is its ability to transform a person. If you want to be punk rocker chic one day and bohemian the next, you can do that with a quick trip to the closet. Fashion is fun but it’s also beautiful and inspiring.

**Do you have any style tips?** The most important style tip is to dress for your body type and to make sure to get things tailored. A $15 dress that fits your body perfectly will always look better than the $200 ill-fitting one.

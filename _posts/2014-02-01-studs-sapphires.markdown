_**Lillian Babaian** is the jewel-drenched and perfectly studded curator of **Studs and Sapphires**. Studs and Sapphires consists of Lillian's take on trends displayed through her colorfully decorated outfits, shot in sunny California. As a graduate of The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, Lillian provides fashionably-smart wardrobe ideas and looks for her readers. Read on, Studs and Sapphires is the perfect source of inspiration for those looking for a healthy dose of studded + slightly sassy style._

**Tell us a little bit about Studs and Sapphires! The name of your blog is so juicy. How'd you come up with it?** I have to admit that it was a spur of the moment thing. I had spent countless hours and days trying to find the perfect name. Since I was planning on focusing more on personal style, my friend asked me to describe myself and my style using different adjectives. My style definitely has a touch of edginess to it and I love to accessorize. Wearing my favorite studded leather jacket at the time and jeweled accessories, Studs defines the touch of edge and Sapphires is a reflection of all the bejeweled accessories. And that is how "Studs & Sapphires" was born.

**Where did (or do!) you go to school and where did you grow up?** I went to school at The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and studied Merchandise Product Development. While working as an Assistant Designer, I went back to school and got my Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management. I am a California native, raised in L.A. Although I love to travel, Southern California is where my heart truly is.

**Your blog is so cute, so candy-colored and bright! What gives you inspiration for your content?** Although I love monocratic styling, candy colors are always fun and add a touch of personality to everything. My content on my blog focuses on personal looks, fashion, beauty, and what inspires me on the daily. If I am in the shopping mood, my content might include a "wish list or what’s hot". If I see myself consistently incorporating a specific trend into my outfits, I might style one look various ways.

**Do you have a favorite blog? What other blogs do you look to for style ideas and inspiration?** I have many bloggers that I go to for style ideas and inspiration. Some of my favorites include L.A natives, Peace Love Shea, Song of Style, and Sincerely Jules. I also love Hungarian blogger Cashmere in Style, because her style is very similar to mine. Most of my style ideas and inspiration comes from street style

**Your hair is so pretty! Does it naturally curl like that? If not... tell us how you do it!** Naturally curly? I WISH! My hair is as straight as it can be! I use a 1" curling iron and it definitely takes a long time to do! (Just ask my friends as they sit and wait for me to get ready!). I plan to incorporate beauty and hair tutorials this year so stay tuned!

**Your photographs are perfect: clear and well lit, with a hint of sparkle! For those who are trying to master the art of photography (with respect to fashion blogging) - what advice can you provide?** You don’t need a great camera or a lot of technical skill to take interesting, inspiring photographs for your blog. You just need the right photography tips.

Lighting – Lighting is the most important aspect when aiming to produce clear and focused images. Take advantage of dry days to photograph outside and the sun does not need to be blazing down, in fact natural sunsets can sometimes create the best pictures.

Location & Background – Always be cautious and consistent with your location and the background of your photos. ( I am still working on this!)
Outfit photos – Aim to fit your entire self into the frame, not forgetting some close up details shots of your accessories or shoes. The best self-portraits are taken with confidence.

Hopefully this is useful to a wide section of bloggers who are interested in improving their photography skills. I am definitely no expert and learn new tips everyday as well.

**Do you blog full-time? If not, would you if you could, and why?** I do not blog full- time at the moment because I also work in the fashion industry during the week. If I could, I would, which will be my focus this upcoming year. My full-time occupation is to inspire individuals daily, whether it's through a motivational story/quote or an outfit that reflects a significant story. I hope to accomplish all of that through my blog, "Studs & Sapphires".

**What's been your look posted on your blog thus far? Why?** My look changes every day depending on my mood. I may be feeling a bit of "rocker chic" one day and "feminine and flirty" the next. However, recently I have been including a touch of plaid and leather in every outfit. I am also a big fan of mixing silhouettes to create a fun dimensional look. I love to experiment with my looks and I’m open to different styles and silhouettes.

**Polka dots or stripes?** Polka dots! Although different stripe variations are a fun look, I can definitely say I own more polka dots in my closet.

**Glitter or sequins?** I don't usually wear glitter or sequins but if I had to choose, I would have to say sequins. Sequined elbow patches or sequined sleeve details are a perfect day-to-night look, and can give any outfit that "glam" you are looking for.

**If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?** I would have started blogging sooner! Before I started my blog, I had been debating for a long time and if there is anything I could have done differently is be more assertive. A few years ago, the blogging industry was not as evolved and influential, whereas now it has become more mass produced. However, I am really grateful and thankful for starting this journey and for all of my followers who have been supporting me and all the new friends I have made along the way.

**You've had great success since you hit the ground with Studs and Sapphires. Do you have any advice for aspiring bloggers?** "Self-confidence is the best outfit. Wear it, rock it and own it". Blogs have significantly impacted our world today and will continue to evolve our future in fashion. A true authentic voice will always find its way to stand out. Stay true to your style and self, you will see endless opportunities come your way!

Through outfit snaps and obsession-worthy trends, **Courtney and Confetti** will have you inspired to take on life with your best fashion foot forward. Learn more about Courtney and her blogging journey through Blogspotter._

**What did you have in mind when you started Courtney & Confetti?** I wanted Courtney & Confetti to be a place where people could be inspired. I wanted a place to showcase all of the items in my closet that I love, and to share all of my favorite brands and stores with fellow fashionistas!

**How did you come up with your tagline, "Live Everyday Throwing Confetti"?** Everyone that I come in contact with always comments on how happy I am. A long time ago I made a habit of being in a good mood and not worrying about the small stuff. My hope for everyone is that they can live their life in such a way and, live everyday as if they were throwing confetti.

**How long have you been blogging? Has it been a worthwhile endeavor so far?** I started blogging in July of 2013 for a company. Interning for them is what sparked my interest in blogging and is what lead me to start Courtney & Confetti. I have been blogging for almost a year and I can say that it has become more than I ever imagined it would be. I had been searching for what felt like the longest time to figure out what I was good at, blogging gave that to me and has fulfilled me in more ways than I could have ever dreamed.

**If you could start your blogging journey all over again, would you change anything?** When I started blogging I was not fully committed to it and did not know everything that it took to be successful. I started blogging and thought that I knew everything there was to know but I was truly so clueless. I have come a long way from then though, thankfully! I would have learned the ins and outs of blogging before I started, instead of trying to teach myself while also maintaining Courtney & Confetti.

**How did you initially decide what to post about?** I started my blog with the intentions of it being a fashion blog and knew that I wanted to share all of my favorite pieces in my closet with my viewers, what I was going to post about was actually the one thing I was certain of when I started.

**Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?** It is so funny, growing up my parents would always rag on me and say that I was “addicted to clothes” or “all you ever want to do is go shopping”. I was never into sports or crazy about school but I always loved clothes and outfit collaborating. I currently do merchandising, marketing and styling for a company in the town that I go to school at and absolutely love it! If I could do anything in the fashion industry, it would be to have my own line of apparel and accessories.

**How would you describe your personal style?** I am definitely very girly. I love heels and wedges and I love getting dressed up. I believe that a good lip color is the best accessory. Anything that is full of bright colors- I want it!

**What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?** During the fall/winter I love to wear leopard and neutrals. In the spring/summer I go for pinks and white and anything with stripes.

**Where are your favorite places to shop and why?** I am obsessed with Nordstrom. The place has anything and everything that you could ever need (or want!). I could easily live inside a Nordstrom and forever be a happy girl.

**Which designers are most inspiring to you?** Kate Spade is my absolute favorite designer. I feel like the whole image of her brand was based around myself. Everything about Kate Spade from her patterns to her famous quotes like "eat cake for breakfast", represent exactly who I am.

**Do you take cues from street style or runway fashion?** I am a sucker for trends because I love experimenting with new things. Since most things on runaway are typically high-end designers, I would say I focus more on street style.

**Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?** My Louis Vuitton tote. I do not use it everyday, but it has saved my life a time or two. If you are going to get a Louis, the Neverfull is without a doubt, your go to.

**Do you take your own photos, or do you have help? Which camera would you recommend?** I have other people take my pictures for me. I have a Nikon DX with a 50mm lens and I love it!

**What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?** You get out of blogging what you put into it. Weeks where I spend a lot of time working on my blog, something exciting happens. On the weeks where I have a lot going on with school and do not spend as much time on it, I typically do not get the rewards that it brings. Having a blog has also taught me to stay true to myself, and what I like. Blogging has taught me to not let people’s criticism get you down or stop you from doing what your heart desires, chances are, they are not doing what you are doing and they have no idea what goes into it.

**Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?** It will take more time than you ever imagined. Blogging has truly become my life (no complaints), and you will not get the benefits of blogging if you do not spend a good amount of your time on it. The beginning phases of blogging can get frustrating but everything is a learning process and well worth it. I am a year into blogging and feel like I still have so much to learn.

interview:
- question: Your blog seems fairly new. What are your plans to develop it further?
  answer: I started my blog in January 2014 so it’s still young. I starting blogging
    here in Vancouver but starting in April I’ll be relocating to Melbourne, Australia.
    I’m not sure what changes that will bring to Lizzy Maric but I’m excited to find
    out.
- question: What made you start blogging in the first place?
  answer: I started blogging back in 2011 with an old blog. It was started at the
    same time I went to school for fashion merchandising and it’s original purpose
    was to be more of an “inspiration blog” rather than photos of myself. It took
    a long time for me to boost up the confidence to post photos of my own outfits
    but I’m glad I did. Plus I thoroughly enjoy bugging my boyfriend to take pictures
    of me.
- question: How long ago did you start?
  answer: I started blogging back in 2011 (coldfashioned.net). I only started Lizzy
    Maric two months ago so it’s still a baby blog!
- question: Do you plan on keeping your posts personal style based?
  answer: Maybe. I have few ideas floating up in my head but haven’t made any decisions
    yet. Again, my blog is still fairly new but I’m always looking for new opportunities
    (as long as it does not involve photoshop as my skills are seriously lacking).
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: My style is ever-changing. I’m inspired by a number of different things
    and frequently change with my environment. Lately I’ve been more of a minimalist
    but that may be because I’ve downsized my wardrobe quite a bit (moving and all).
    Someone once described my style as “grunge meets glamour” but that was with my
    old blog. I feel like I’ve grown since then - I’ve become a bit more sophisticated
    with my style.
- question: Why did you want to keep your blog simple and clean, graphics-wise?
  answer: I wanted my photos to stand out the most. I’ve always found busy blogs to
    be distracting and I wanted my readers to focus on my content rather than what
    surrounds it.
- question: Why did you choose to name your blog after you?
  answer: I wish I knew the answer! I bounced around a couple names but I kept getting
    bored with them. It’s pretty hard to get bored with your own name so I stuck with
    it - plus I had already purchased the domain.
- question: Do you gravitate more toward basics or bold prints?
  answer: Usually basic, but I do like to surprise myself with a little print now
    and them
- question: Neutrals or bright hues?
  answer: I used to be all about bright hues - until I had a closet full of baby blue
    and corals (and colour blocking was on its way out). This past year I’ve stuck
    with neutrals.
- question: What is your most-loved color or texture combination?
  answer: I love working with basic colours (see above).
- question: Do you have any interesting posts or categories planned for the future?
  answer: I do! You’ll have to wait and see!
- question: What was the most difficult part of getting your blog up and running?
  answer: Getting up the courage to post my pictures to the public (I’m shy sometimes).
- question: What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?
  answer: What makes this blog so special to me is that I started writing it for myself.
    When I used to blog I wrote my posts very clean and was always concerned what
    people thought of it (I was very self-conscious). Once I started writing in my
    own voice I noticed my blog had changed (why I switched blogs in the first place).
    So I guess to answer your question I don’t have a specific message to convey -
    I just want to (hopefully) provide some inspiration with a bit of entertainment.
- question: What has maintaining a blog taught you so far?
  answer: It’s a lot more work than I thought it would be! It’s definitely taught
    be to stay disciplined.
- question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers ready to get started?
  answer: Grow a pair and do it.

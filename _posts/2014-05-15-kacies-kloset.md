  - question: How long have you been blogging?
    answer: I’ve been blogging since April 2012 so just a little over two years.
  - question: How did you choose a name for your blog?

    answer: Yes, I think my blog has stayed true to the original idea. Although, I have been thinking about adding a few beauty posts. Many people have been asking for a hair tutorial.
  - question: What made you want to share your personal style?
    answer: Working from home, I felt like a lot of my cute outfits went to waist. My dogs just didn’t seem to appreciate my good outfits and my husband didn’t have much of an opinion on them either. I love sharing my love for fashion with other fashionistas.

    answer: I’d describe my style as dressy-casual. I wear a lot of jeans and I’m always in heels.

    answer: I get a lot of inspiration from fashion bloggers, celebrities, and my favorite magazine People StyleWatch.
  - question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
    answer: Jeans! My two favorites are my medium wash Dittos jeans and black J Brand jeans. I’m also obsessed with my chambray top.
  - question: Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which sites do you feel are crucial?
    answer: I post to all my social media account at least once a day but Instagram is definitely my favorite. Staying active on social media is a very important component of blogging.
  - question: If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?
    answer: I can’t really think of anything I would change. I’ve enjoyed every step along the way. If I had to choose something, I wish I would have thought of a more creative blog name. Although, I can’t think of anything I would want to change it to so Kacie’s Kloset it will stay.
  - question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
    answer: The importance of time management. I work from home so it would be easy for me to get distracted by everyday household things. Staying organized and focused is key.
  - question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers?
    answer: I know it’s cliché to say but the best advice is to be yourself. Your readers want to get to know and connect with you. It’s also important to stay active with the blogging community.

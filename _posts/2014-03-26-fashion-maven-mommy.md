  - question: Tell us about Fashion Maven Mommy!
    answer: Fashion Maven Mommy is a collection of all things beauty and fashion that I’ve personally fallen in love with. I made a conscious decision early on to keep my blog positive... you will not find any negativity here! If I've tried it and loved it, I enjoy sharing it with my readers! It is best described as a cup of beauty with a sprinkle of fashion!
  - question: When did you begin blogging, and what was it that gave you the inspiration and idea for Fashion Maven Mommy?
    answer: I embarked on this pretty little journey, Fashion Maven Mommy in December 2011. After years and years of searching for a creative outlet, it finally occurred to me… I could blog! From that very moment, everything changed. I felt as though I could finally exhale! This was a new chapter and I couldn’t wait to see where this wonderful road would take me! Initially, I thought this was going to be a fashion blog (hence the name), however, my love for beauty really took center stage and so I just went with it. I guess you can say I’m an accidental beauty blogger!
  - question: You were a finalist in Allure's Beauty Blogger of the Year Awards - how exciting! How did you get involved with the competition, and what did you learn from it?
    answer: About two months into blogging, while searching for a way to take my blog to the next level, I came across a double page spread in Allure Magazine. It was as though the universe spoke to me directly. And if the universe speaks... you listen right?! I could hardly believe it when I got the call that I was selected as an alternate! Yes, an alternate… this was the first time around! I literally spent the entire year perfecting my blog with a single mission… to make it to the actual contest the following year! I entered again and I could barely contain my excitement when I got the call from Allure telling me that they totally remembered my blog and loved it. And just like that... I was officially one of the 10 finalists! Best. Day. Ever!
  - question: You're a beauty blogger and a mother - how do you find time to balance it all? Do you set a personal schedule or weekly goals to keep everything up-to-date?
    answer: It's definitely a challenge juggling it all. I take my 'mommy duties' very seriously! However, I whole heartedly believe that when you are passionate about something, you just make the time. After tucking my girls to bed, I officially switch to FMM mode. It's exhausting, yes, but so rewarding! I do keep a journal of ideas and posts that I need to complete. However, when I begin to feel pressure to complete a post I try and remind myself that this is not my job. I never want it to feel like a job! This is my passion and I much prefer to write from the heart. So if one week I complete two posts and another week I complete five, that’s OK!
  - question: What's your favorite beauty brand?
    answer: OMG do I have to pick just one?! I have soooooo many that I love equally... Stila, NARS, MAC, Urban Decay, Benefit... the list goes on and on!
  - question: Straight hair or waves?
    answer: Both!
  - question: If you could only have one beauty product in your arsenal - what would it be, and why?
    answer: It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye is pretty much the holy grail of concealers! And let's face it, as a mommy of twins, I'm often sleep deprived! This baby continuously saves my life!
  - question: Liquid eyeliner or pencil eyeliner?
    answer: My current obsession is a great liquid liner pen! I love a fierce cat eye... meow!
  - question: What makeup artists do you look to for inspiration?
    answer: I'm a huge fan of Sarah Lucero of Stila! I've recreated many looks inspired by her work on my blog. She's just such a talent, and while I don't know her personally, I feel like she must be the most amazing person. I'd love to meet her some day. Most recently, I became obsessed with the gorgeous looks she created for the Alice and Olivia show during Fall 2014 NYFW. Major blog inspiration right there!
  - question: Twitter or Pinterest?
    answer: Both! They’re so different! Twitter is a great place to share a thought or two. Pinterest is a place of inspiration, organization and major distraction! I spend way too much time pinning all kinds of wonderful things that I will never do! But still... it's there just in case!
  - question: What's the coolest thing that's happened to you since you started blogging?
    answer: Hands down, being a finalist in Allure's BBA! That was such a major moment for me! I mean... hello! Allure = beauty bible!
  - question: Let's talk about social media&#058; do you find that social media has been vital to the success of Fashion Maven Mommy?
    answer: Absolutely, social media is a beautiful thing! I've met some wonderful friends, amazing bloggers and I can’t wait to meet more! Instagram is my current fave! I just love the instant gratification factor.
  - question: What's one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?
    answer: Blogging has taught me to believe in myself and in my dreams! Who would have thought when I began this little journey of mine that Allure Magazine would take notice! It just goes to show... if you have a passion for something, pursue it! If it comes from the heart... then it's right!
  - question: If you could offer one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be, and why?
    answer: Believe in yourself and blog from the heart! Stay true to yourself and what you love to do. I know it sounds cliché but truthfully, your heart will never steer your wrong! Well, maybe a few times in High School but you know what I mean!

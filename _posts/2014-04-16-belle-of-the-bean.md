interview:
- question: How long have you been blogging?
  answer: About 2 years
- question: When you started Belle of the Bean, what did you have in mind?
  answer: To share my personal style with the world and to answer a question that
    I often get – &#8220;Where did you get that?&#8221;
- question: How did you come up with the name for your blog?
  answer: Just some thought... I wanted something that included my hometown. Some
    of us refer to Boston as "The Bean" (short for Beantown).
- question: What is your main source of style inspiration?
  answer: I like to flip through fashion magazines to see what the latest trends are
    but I usually go with what works best for my body type. Being petite, I can’t
    wear every single trend, regardless if I love it. I also love Christine Centenera.
    She’s just so effortlessly chic!
- question: What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?
  answer: I love color-blocking, mixing prints/patterns and adding just a pop of color
    to an otherwise monochromatic look.
- question: Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?
  answer: H&M, Arden B., ASOS, Armani Exchange, Nordstrom. I’m super petite and wear
    size 34/4 in shoes so these stores all carry the latest styles in sizes that fit
    and flatter my body type. Nordstrom is the only department store that carries
    shoes in my size and their customer service is exceptional.
- question: Which city's style do you feel encapsulates your own?
  answer: I think LA. Weirdly, I get asked if I’m from California a lot. I would say
    I'm pretty laid back so cut-off shorts, a loose tee and sandals seem to be my
    uniform in the summertime. Every time it snows, my inner Cali-girl always asks,
    &#8220;Why do you live here?&#8221; But I love Boston.
- question: Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?
  answer: My &#8220;destroyed&#8221; Hudson Jeans. They’re the most comfortable pair
    of jeans I’ve ever owned. Thongs – TMI I know, but I despise panty lines and "wedgies."
    High heels – because I’m a shorty. Chambray shirt because it can be worn so many
    ways and can be dressed up or down.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: I usually dress according to my mood, but I would say it’s usually comfy-chic.
- question: Is there a look or piece that feels very you when you wear it?
  answer: In the summer I like to wear denim shorts with a long sleeve top to take
    me into the breezy nights and maybe a fedora and/or a pair of shades.
- question: Who are some of your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?
  answer: I'm a huge fan of Coco Chanel. Her pieces are like works of art and timeless.
    And those handbags are to die for!
- question: How do you go about selecting outfits worthy of posting?
  answer: I usually go with the ones where I can link the item to be purchased or
    to a similar item. A lot of times my readers want to know where they can get a
    specific piece and I like to be able to direct them to it through my links.
- question: How long does an average blog post take?
  answer: About 45 minutes, depending on how much media I’m including in the post.
- question: What main message would you like to convey to your readers?
  answer: I'm forever grateful and so appreciative for the support and interest in
    my blog, especially being a fairly new blogger.
- question: Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?
  answer: Stay true to yourself and post what you like, not what you think your readers
    will like. When you're not being yourself it usually doesn't end well. Be interactive
    with readers/fellow bloggers who support your blog. Also if you are patient and
    dedicated to your blog, you will eventually get the results that you want.

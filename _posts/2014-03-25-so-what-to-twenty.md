- question: Because your blog is fashion and style from a 40+ perspective, do you
    feel that you have more knowledge and experience under your fabulous belt?
  answer: I don't feel I have more experience in blogging since I just began in June
    2013. I do, however, believe that I bring a bit more knowledge to the table about
    the fashion industry as a whole. With many bloggers, it is about the clothes.
    Don't get me wrong, I love clothing, but So What to Twenty is more about personal
    style and the important role it plays in being your personal best.
- question: Besides the above, what else makes you different from other fashion bloggers?
  answer: My educational experience from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising
    has played a very important role in my love for the industry. I graduated from
    FIDM in 1986 with a degree in Marketing & Merchandising. In addition, I have worked
    in many aspects of the fashion industry from personal stylist to a Fashion & Style
    columnist for a weekly newspaper.
- question: What made you start blogging in the first place?
  answer: I began as a way to release tension from a very stressful situation I was
    in. I find writing and writing about style very therapeutic.
- question: Was it difficult to get your blog up and running?
  answer: No, it wasn't difficult to launch it at all. I have the time to work on
    it, and a tech-savvy husband.
- question: What has been your biggest challenge so far?
  answer: My biggest challenge has been gaining the audience. I want the public to
    trust that I'll have interesting content.
- question: How did you come up with the sassy name for your blog?
  answer: Thank you for asking this question. Well, first of all let me begin by stating
    that it is in no way a slight to younger women. So What to Twenty is saying...
    I am still viable, I can still rock a look, I am still beautiful in spite of what
    society tries to say about women of a certain age... so, So What to Twenty! Understand?
    It is more of a mantra to women who have been seasoned with time.
- question: Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?
  answer: I thoroughly enjoy shopping at vintage boutiques, as well as non-descript
    shops that are off the beaten path. Also, I am an eBay fanatic. But for more mainstream
    shopping, I LOVE the world market, the vintage feel of Anthropologie. I like these
    places because I don’t have the fear of seeing myself coming and going. I like
    individuality.
- question: What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never replace?
  answer: I have jewelry that I inherited from my mother and maternal grandmother
    that is irreplaceable and holds such precious memories for me. Also, when I was
    17, I fell in love with a pair of chocolate leather riding boots by Marc Alpert
    of Italy. To earn the money for them, I wrote an essay to my father explaining
    how I would cherish them forever. I still have them and blogged about them in
    a post called Equestrian Legacy.
- question: Where do you find style inspiration?
  answer: I am greatly influenced by the 1950s era. Actresses such as Audrey Hepburn,
    Kate Hepburn, Grace Kelly and First lady Jackie Onassis influence me. Overall,
    my mood and temperament, the California lifestyle are all some of my style inspirations.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: I like to say that I shop for items that have no expiration date. My style
    is Classic + a touch of Boho + a little quirk. The base of my wardrobe mostly
    consists of great classic pieces, but I enjoy mixing my classics with bohemian
    influences and always a touch of quirk. It just makes the look for interesting.
- question: Who are some of your favorite designers and why?
  answer: That is tough to answer because every year such fantastic new designers
    hit the scene. I'll have to say that my number ones are&#058; Michael Kors, Carolina
    Herrera, Tracy Reese, Marni, Ralph Lauren and Chloe. I adore these designers the
    most because they best fit my personal style that I mentioned above.
- question: What has maintaining a blog taught you?
  answer: PATIENCE!
- question: What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?
  answer: Those who follow So What to Twenty will know that I have a true passion
    for the fashion industry as a whole. I truly hope that this message is being conveyed.
    I also hope that people take that there is a big difference in BEING IN STYLE
    verses HAVING STYLE. The latter is what I strive toward. I won't run out and purchase
    the latest trends. What I do work toward is creating a perfectly curated wardrobe
    that is built to fit my style.
- question: Do you feel that your blog is targeted only to women your age, or do you
    think anyone could benefit from your posts?
  answer: No, not at all. I believe that So What to Twenty is for ALL women, regardless
    of age, for the simple fact, it is not all about fashion and more about style.
    There is a difference. There is a quote that best sums it up – Fashion fades by
    style is eternal.
- question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers of any age?
  answer: I'm not sure I'm in the position to give advice for blogging since I am
    still finding my way. But ask me anything about style and fashion and I can at
    least point you in the right direction...

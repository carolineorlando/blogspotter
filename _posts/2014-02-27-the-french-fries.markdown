_**The French Fries** came to be over a lunch of sodas and (you guessed it!) french fries. It was once just a casual conversation. Today it is a record of the personal style and inspirations of **Carolina**, an architect, fashion enthusiast, and creative type from Portugal. She is passionate about architecture and about giving readers an exclusive look at the treasures within her closet. We chatted with this busy beauty to spot her unique blogger quirks. Learn more about Carolina and The French Fries with Blogspotter below._

**How did you come up with the name "The French Fries"? It's so different from other fashion blog names - it really stands out! (We love it!)** Thank you so much! So... a lot of you ask me that question, and I smile and have no better answer than this: I just love french fries!

**So, Carolina, how long have you been blogging for?** One year and a half now.

**Why did you start? Was it your passion for style and fashion, or something else?** Yup. I created The French Fries on a summer afternoon between French fries and sodas. I start publishing because I just love clothes, fabrics, prints, colors... I've been thinking about it for a long time, and some amazing people helped me out to start!

**Did you study fashion in university/college?** No, I'm an architect, I finished my master last November.

**How would you describe your personal style?** I'm a creative type. I like mixing stuff, but with a classic vibe. I think the best adjective is eclectic

**Do you blog full-time? If not, how frequently do you post blog entries on The French Fries?** No, I have a normal job, I work on a studio, so I try to post as much as I can. Normally 20 posts per month, more or less.

**What’s your favorite season: Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter?** Summer for sure. I need sun and shorts in my life. I'm a beach girl.

**Florals or stripes?** Floral with stripes!

**Coffee or tea?** I really don’t like coffee (at all!) Tea!

**If you could have done anything differently since you started The French Fries, what would it be, and why?** I just would have had more patience.

**Your hair is so long and beautiful! What's your secret?** I really don't have any. Do you believe that I receive e-mails asking me that? And when that happens, I just call my mom and dad I say thank you! Ahah really, I just use a normal shampoo (Pantene pro-v) and a blow dry, I don’t use anything else.

**If your best friend was about to launch a blog and she asked you for just one insider tip, what would you say?** A lot of patience, and a no-stress attitude. And always remember why you have a blog, your passions, and goals.

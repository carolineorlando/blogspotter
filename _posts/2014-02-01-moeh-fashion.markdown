_Inspired by a little bit of everything, **Colby Milano** started **Moeh Fashion** to catalog her highly sophisticated yet easily emulated style. She has graduated from her days of chunky platforms to simpler, classier pieces, giving her that cool girl je ne sais quoi that is hard to look away from. Her enviable travel destinations and laidback vibes make Moeh Fashion an inspiration destination for budding It Girls everywhere._

**Tell us about your blog!** Moeh Fashion started as a personal project. I had just started college, and being that I attend FIT, I knew I would be networking with a lot of people in the fashion industry and I really wanted some sort of portfolio that I could give. My blog started out as just that, and as I was experimenting with posts I realized how much I enjoyed blogging. I started sharing my personal style, photography, any collaborations and work I was doing.

**Where did you get the name from?** The name was inspired by 2 things. Mo, in a very informal way, means more. Since I knew I wasn't the first to be sharing personal style on the web, I felt I was just sharing more fashion. I then took the spelling of my best friends moms name, Moeh, who had inspired me in my younger fashion years and combined it with the idea of more fashion. Hence, Moeh Fashion.

**What is your favorite part of blogging?** My favorite part about blogging is exploring to find good places to shoot. My blog gives me a reason to get out and see new places with friends or visit usual spots just for fun. It also keeps me motivated, busy, and always on my toes with new ideas.

**What other blogs/websites do you read?** I get most of my daily reads from Facebook, Twitter, and/or Pinterest. Refinery29 is one of my favorite websites to browse for news and fashion. It's very easy to get lost in their website which is why I enjoy it so much.

**How do you get your inspiration?** A lot of my inspiration has come from Pinterest. It's been a platform that allows me to gather all of the ideas and things I like including more than just outfits. I find my inspiration comes from seeing style in all fields such as interiors, food, travel, beauty, as well as fashion.

**How has blogging changed your outlook on fashion and personal style?** I think the whole concept took me by surprise. The opportunities for bloggers in the industry right now are definitely pretty amazing. It's also very inspiring to be able to inspire others with everyday looks. Many people can't take a high-end magazine and replicate what they like into to real life fashion. Personal style bloggers make that much easier for their followers. I think it also goes to show how much opportunity there is in fashion in general. Opinions are everything in this industry, express yours on the Internet and you may be sitting front row at next fashion week.

**What are some of your favorite designers/brands?** I love discovering new and smaller brands. I am currently in Australia, and discovering Aussie brands has been a lot of fun. A few I love are Seafolly Australia, Mode Collective, and Zimmermann.

**How would you describe your style?** I laugh because if I were asked this questions 3 years ago my answer would've been extremely different. There's something amazing about growing up and the changes a person can go through mentally as well as physically. I love being able to look at my old posts, when I was wearing chunky rings and chunky platform heels on a daily basis. Now I resort to basics, denim and a lot of black. I prefer a minimal and mature look at the moment and I feel a lot more comfortable being in something practical, minimal, yet stylish.

**What is your first memory of fashion?** My first fashion memory definitely had to have been trying on all of my older sisters clothing. I remember I used to be so upset because nothing fit me. I was too small to wear "big girl" clothing and I couldn't wait until I could get their hand-me downs.

**Favorite fashion quote or motto?** This doesn’t have much to do with fashion but it's one of my favorite quotes, and filed under #wordstoliveby. "Do not chase people. Be you and do your own thing and work hard. The right people who belong in your life will come to you, and stay."

**What is the key to having a good sense of style?** The best way to having a good sense of style is being aware of what works for your body and then stick with it.

**Quick, think of your wardrobe (however big it may be!). What's your favorite garment?** A vintage oversized black/navy blazer that originally had long sleeves and shoulder pads so big you can easily be confused with a football player. I decided to chop off the sleeves and take out the pads, and now I have a very structured and long blazer vest. It is the perfect layering piece for both summer and winter. I wear it over jackets, under jackets, by itself, and just about everything else possible.

**What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?** I find a lot of people think having a blog is easy, but they don’t realize how time consuming the process can be until they begin and fail. My advice is if this is truly your passion, or hobby then it is an amazing way to create and share your content, meet new people, and potentially start your own business. It’s been an amazing journey!

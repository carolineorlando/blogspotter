interview:
- question: How did you come up with the name &#8220;The French Fries&#8221;? It's
    so different from other fashion blog names - it really stands out! (We love it!)
  answer: Thank you so much! So... a lot of you ask me that question, and I smile
    and have no better answer than this&#058; I just love french fries!
- question: So, Carolina, how long have you been blogging for?
  answer: One year and a half now.
- question: Why did you start? Was it your passion for style and fashion, or something
    else?
  answer: Yup. I created The French Fries on a summer afternoon between French fries
    and sodas. I start publishing because I just love clothes, fabrics, prints, colors...
    I've been thinking about it for a long time, and some amazing people helped me
    out to start!
- question: Did you study fashion in university/college?
  answer: No, I'm an architect, I finished my master last November.
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: I'm a creative type. I like mixing stuff, but with a classic vibe. I think
    the best adjective is eclectic
- question: Do you blog full-time? If not, how frequently do you post blog entries
    on The French Fries?
  answer: No, I have a normal job, I work on a studio, so I try to post as much as
    I can. Normally 20 posts per month, more or less.
- question: What’s your favorite season&#058; Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter?
  answer: Summer for sure. I need sun and shorts in my life. I'm a beach girl.
- question: Florals or stripes?
  answer: Floral with stripes!
- question: Coffee or tea?
  answer: I really don’t like coffee (at all!) Tea!
- question: If you could have done anything differently since you started The French
    Fries, what would it be, and why?
  answer: I just would have had more patience.
- question: Your hair is so long and beautiful! What's your secret?
  answer: I really don't have any. Do you believe that I receive e-mails asking me
    that? And when that happens, I just call my mom and dad I say thank you! Ahah
    really, I just use a normal shampoo (Pantene pro-v) and a blow dry, I don’t use
    anything else.
- question: If your best friend was about to launch a blog and she asked you for just
    one insider tip, what would you say?
  answer: A lot of patience, and a no-stress attitude. And always remember why you
    have a blog, your passions, and goals.

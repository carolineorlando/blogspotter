interview:
- question: Tell us a little bit about BEING/BE.
  answer: I started my blog to showcase my passion for fashion. The greatest way I
    know to express myself is through fashion and the more I learn about the industry
    the more I evolve; my personality, my mood, and sometimes a coffee and/or wine
    spill is evident through my outfit. After countless hours of following amazing
    fashion bloggers I decided to start my own to share my creativity in hopes that
    people will see that style, just like the little ole word "be", is limitless.
- question: We’re so curious&#58; how did you come up with the name "BEING/BE"?
  answer: If you were to look up the word “be” in the dictionary, the definition would
    bore you with the simplicity and vagueness of it. But then again how do you sum
    up the magnitude of the word? In my opinion, BE is to exist, it’s to take place,
    to happen or occur, it means to continue or remain as before; BE is whatever you
    want it to be. That is where the name of the blog came from. I live by a mantra
    of always being who you are. Well, I'm Being/BE-BreAnne Elenburg.
- question: When did you officially start blogging?
  answer: End of August 2014
- question: You blog about style and beauty. What’s your favorite thing to blog about?
  answer: Definitely style; beauty is a blast, don’t get me wrong, but fashion is
    always changing and I love the opportunity my followers give me to keep them up
    to date with the latest trends.
- question: Did you formally study fashion as an undergrad? If not, do you find that
    you’re able to incorporate what you did study into your blog?
  answer: Yes! I was extremely fortunate to study Fashion Merchandising at Texas Christian
    University.
- question: QUICK! Hot pink or bright yellow?
  answer: Hot pink all the way!
- question: What's your favorite brand?
  answer: Oh wow, this a toughie! It’s hard to say what my favorite brand is because
    they all have unique qualities about them that I like to add to my wardrobe. BUT-
    I will say you can normally find me in at least one item from J.Crew or Madewell.
    However, if we are talking designers, I would definitely have to say YSL!
- question: How would you describe your personal style?
  answer: As I mentioned a bit in why I started my blog, defining my personal style
    would be impossible. I dress how I feel that particular day and this can range
    from an all-black ensemble for a simple trip to the grocery store to ripped jeans
    with a flannel and converse for a night out with my girls. You just simply never
    know!
- question: QUICK! What’s your favorite guilty pleasure food?
  answer: Popcorn! I could eat popcorn for every meal! Add extra butter and nacho
    cheese seasoning salt and you have heaven in a bucket!
- question: Do you have a favorite outfit in your wardrobe? What is it?
  answer: My go-to outfit when I’m having just "one of those days" is my most comfortable
    pair of jeans, a simple top and some type of jacket (usually I go with leather
    to spice up my life a bit). This outfit is then paired with either flats or pumps,
    but don’t even try to ask what my favorite pair of shoes is because that is an
    impossible question!
- question: Let’s talk Texas! What’s your favorite thing about Texas, and the south?
  answer: I love the southern hospitality of living in Texas. Everyone is friendly
    and I love meeting someone only to feel like I’ve known them my whole life after
    just five minutes of talking! I also can’t go without mentioning teased hair.
    Big hair is such a Texas thing and I’m obsessed with it! The bigger the hair the
    closer to Heaven!
- question: Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance
    with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?
  answer: There are a number of successful bloggers that I keep up with on a daily
    basis. These women are incredibly inspirational to me and I love how each blog
    is unique in its own way. I also try to stay on top of major retailers and designers
    to see up and coming trends. And of course, Pinterest; what girl doesn’t love
    Pinterest?
- question: Who takes your photos for you?
  answer: Amanda Marie Lackey is my amazing photographer!
- question: What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?
  answer: Creating a blog has definitely had its ups and downs. It’s not as easy as
    it looks! Developing your own unique way that is consistent requires you to look
    into yourself and figure out the way you want to be perceived. I’ve learned that
    patience is key and I won’t have a billion dedicated followers overnight, as well.
    Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had because it has taught
    me to be comfortable in my own skin. There is no right or wrong way to be a blogger
    except to just be myself and enjoy what I do!
- question: What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?
  answer: The ability to express myself is definitely the most rewarding component
    of blogging. There is a much deeper level of satisfaction when you can share your
    passion with the world.
- question: Any advice for aspiring bloggers?
  answer: Be YOU! You can try your best to mimic other bloggers but at the end of
    the day you want to be yourself.

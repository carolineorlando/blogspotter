    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Emily Fogarty</strong> of <strong>The Style Hunter</strong> hunts it down so you can be inspired. It’s worth taking notes. Her glam-yet-wearable looks are ones you’ll want to remember. A perfectly put together ensemble is not the only thing you’ll want to copy. She keeps us chic with hair tutorials and shopping ideas, including but not limited to Piperlime, ASOS, and Zara. Next time you’re in a style rut, consult Emily to hunt for a way out.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>You’re a Savannah-based, glitter-obsessed brunette. Tell us a little bit about The Style Hunter and how you came up with the name.</strong> When I first started blogging, I had a different name, and absolutely no photos of myself. I just wanted to have an outlet to express myself creatively. It was basically a glorified Pinterest, before Pinterest was the fabulous beast that it is! The change from that blog, to The Style Hunter was a long time coming. I battled with myself about making the switch to putting myself front and center, literally. The name came from wanting to show my readers that you don’t have to have a full on designer wardrobe to feel good about your style. It’s about finding a look from Pinterest, or a girl you pass by in the grocery store, the look that makes you stop while flipping through a magazine and then “hunting” for how to make that look yours.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>What made you decide to start blogging?</strong> I have always been a shopper. Loving all things fashion, burying my nose deep into the September issues of my favorite magazines and mixing patterns and textures. Deemed the fashionable one of my friends, I am the one who brings extra outfits and jewelry on any vacation, just incase anyone needs to borrow. So, the idea to start blogging was a natural one.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I have only been The Style Hunter for about 4 or 5 months. I’m a baby blogger, but I have already learned so much and continue to learn every day.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Has social media played an important role in the growth of The Style Hunter?</strong> Social media is everything. I can’t stress it enough. I have met so many fabulous bloggers via Twitter and Instagram. Pinterest is the ultimate inspiration hub. It’s amazing how you can meet ladies you’ve never actually met face-to-face and know so much about them.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Aside from your own blog, do you have a favorite blog? What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong> OhMyGosh… I have so many favorite blogs. Some of my all time favorites are Gal Meets Glam, Happily Grey and my all time style icon Courtney Kerr of What Courtney Wore (and a Bravo-lebrity). She’s literally everything, and if you don’t know her….just look it up! You won’t be sorry.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Do you blog full-time?</strong> It is definitely a side project for now, but I admire anyone who can make it a full-time job. That would be one of my reach for the sky, knock out of the park dream goals!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I think my style is pretty classic and feminine, with a little bit of edge. I like to take risks and wear things that others might not think about. I like mixing unexpected items, in a way that (fingers crossed…) seems effortless. When shopping I definitely look for shapes that are flattering, a really good pair of jeans (or like 5), and pops of color. I definitely have a few favorites that will always stand out and you will see of too often in my closet. Anything navy. Jumpsuits. Studded pieces. Polka dots. Fur. Stripes. Oversized baubles. Boyfriend button up shirts. Leggings. Nail Polish. Leather.

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Fashion week is here! You’re in Savannah, Georgia, so do you watch the shows via live streams from Lincoln Center? If so, do you have any favorite trends you’ve spotted on the runway?</strong> Instagram, Instagram, Instagram. All bets are off for New York Fashion Week as I shamelessly stalked my all-time favorite bloggers who kept me feeling like I was right there in-between Anna Wintour and Anna Kendrick, getting an up close and personal look at every look and videos of the final walks. Style.com is also a go-to for everything NYFW. Up close and personal.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p">As for favorite trends, I am drooling over Tory Burch and her mix of prints, textures and over-the-knee “Catholic School Girl” socks. Alice + Olivia was literally a dream. Filled with luxe details like fur, lace and rich hues. Y’all it was something else. Another favorite of mine was Milly. It looks like a very luxurious and well-dressed ballerina was floating all the way down that runway. There are a pair of fringe pants that are sheer perfection.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Tell us one unconventional thing that blogging has taught you.</strong> The one thing that surprised me is feeling like other bloggers are your besties after one bonding sesh over the latest J. Crew collection or what happened on The Bachelor via Twitter. The community that bloggers have made is amazing, and one I am super proud to be a part of! I have met so many fabulous, and clearly fashionable ladies through the Southern Blog Society, which I am a member of. Look them up for TONS of awesome gals!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Your photos are perfect. What kind of camera do you use?</strong> Ohmy! Way to make a gal blush! I however, can take none of the credit when it comes to my photography. I am beyond lucky to have known my photographer since diapers. Marianne Brown of Marianne Lucille Photography, is a local photographer in Savannah, who puts up with my giggly fits whenever I get in front of the camera and manages to grab some gorgeous shots! We have been lifelong friends and she is amazing! She uses a Canon 60D and a 50mm 1.4 lens. She likes to use Lightroom to edit the pictures, while deleting the ones I look absolutely ridiculous in, and the VSCOfilm presets.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> Nothing! I am still a little bit of a newbie, so I can’t quite say I’ve done anything I regret. I think as long as you are authentic there is nothing to regret or change.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Wedges or pumps?</strong> Wedges.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Sequins or glitter?</strong> Now this is a toughy. I love sparkle, in all forms. So I guess I would say sequins for clothes and glitter for DIY projects.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Aviators or Jackie-O’s?</strong> Aviators. I absolutely LOVE the mirrored trend.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--18 p"><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Be authentic. Have a clear picture of what you want to accomplish with your blog. Readers often look at bloggers as if they are experts, so be one. Put time and effort into your photos. Quality photography makes all the difference! It shows your readers that you care about what you are giving them, so they will be more likely to buy into it. And patience. I am still learning this one. Just because you start posting consistently, doesn’t mean you will magically become blogger famous (sad day!). Comments will come, followers will happen, just remember that it takes time and work.

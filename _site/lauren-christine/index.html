    <p class="p--2 p"><em>In an aim to spark self expression in her visitors, <strong>Lauren Kawano</strong> of <strong>Lauren Christine</strong> started blogging via Tumblr. Her little corner of the web is filled with inspiring images, from her beyond chic daily looks to Alexander McQueen runway footage. A self-described “odd duck”, Lauren likes to do what others don’t, and her blog shines with originality. Read more about Lauren and her learning process with Blogspotter.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I started truly blogging on my instagram account about a year ago, and my Tumblr followed suit soon after.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>What made you start Lauren Christine?</strong> I have always had this extreme love for all things fashion and style. I’ve worked with Urban Outfitters for years now and I think working there really sparked my love for clothing.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>Why did you decide to blog on Tumblr?</strong> I love Tumblr. I think the set up is clean and effervescent. You can make your page look however you want it to, and it all just flows. Instagram is where my heart is though. I love creating an Instagram account that’s aesthetically pleasing. Everything has to make sense in the big picture, I think that’s easier accomplished with Tumblr, but I try very hard to accomplish that with my Instagram as well.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>When you started your blog, what did you have in mind?</strong> I wanted a page that inspired people to think differently. Something that made people question how they thought and felt about fashion. Alexander McQueen is my idol. And his clothing is art. It shocks people and makes them really think. I just love that about clothing, it’s truly art.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Has it stayed true to that original idea? How has it evolved?</strong> I think it has definitely stayed true to original idea I was going for. I post a lot of trendy things, but I try to stick mostly to fashion related things. I can’t help posting a beautiful scenery shot here and there though.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Why did you want to share your inspirations?</strong> I think that its important for people to get a chance to express themselves how they choose. Everyone is expressing something through their style of dress, and I wanted to share how I like to dress hoping that it sparks some interest in other peoples’ self expression.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>How would you describe your own style?</strong> Oh my goodness, where to start. I don’t really have one honestly. I say bohemian a lot because I love oversized clothing, but I change my mind too often to really have a sense of only one style. I go with what I’m feeling that day, super girly and chic, or rocker chick and laid back. It really changes from day to day.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Do things, post things and write about things that truly inspire you and bring happiness to your life." <em>&mdash; Lauren Kawano</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Two words. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN. He was such a brilliant man, and constantly pushed the envelope. I absolutely love and worship his clothing. If I could, I would but every piece from his Plato’s Atlantis collection and have it kept neatly in a glass box just so I could admire it daily. His clothing is created for women who don’t care about society’s view of fashion. It’s made for women who dress the way they choose to because THEY CHOSE TO, not because it’s trendy. I love him for that.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Do you take more cues from street style or runway fashion?</strong> Street style, always and forever.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>How do you go about choosing post-worthy outfits and makeup looks?</strong> I don’t sit and contemplate that much, when I see what I like I instantly post it, that’s just how I’ve always been. I know what I like and what I don’t.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> I have been given some fun opportunities throughout my blogging career. I’ve gotten some chances to work with up and coming clothing companies, swimwear companies and up and coming blogs. I think the best opportunity that I’ve been given is the gift of friendship. It’s crazy the people you meet through blogging, everyone I’ve come across have been a joy to work with and I’m lucky for that.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> Not a thing. It’s a learning process. I used to really care how people would react to my blog and my photos and now I try to focus more on being true to myself. I post and say what I want to, in hopes people will like it but if they don’t, I don’t sweat it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> To be organized. I have always been organized but when blogging it really comes into play. You must know when you should post, what you should post, how many photos to post at once and all that fun jazz. Organization is key to good blogging!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey through Lauren Christine?</strong> To be yourself! I have always been kind of an odd duck, I like to do what others don’t and I like to be an individual. I think it’s important for people to know that being different isn’t bad, and I think that’s the main thing I want to convey. Just be you, always no matter what.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be honest with yourself. Do things, post things and write about things that truly inspire you and bring happiness to your life, I find that it transcends and your followers will feel that.

    <p class="p--2 p"><em>We’re totally into Kristyn Royster of Primp &amp; Proper. It’s something about her style, or maybe her glittery southern charm, but we’re sure you’ll feel the same way. Originally from Tennessee but currently residing in Washington, D.C., Kristyn blogs about fashion, style, and more, collaborating with awesome brands like H&amp;M; and Julep. The bubbly blonde gave us a sneak peek into her blogging world. Meet <strong>Kristyn</strong> with Blogspotter today!</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for Primp &amp; Proper and what made you start?</strong> I’ve been blogging for 13+ months now. I originally started blogging back in January 2014 as a way to document my adventures in DC… a.k.a. provide an outlet for my family to keep up with what I’ve been doing, ha! After I got more and more into the blogging scene of DC, I decided to commit fully and grow my blog way beyond an online journal of my time in DC.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>We love all the gold and glitter in your branding. How did you decide on a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?</strong> Thanks! When it came to the design and layout, I wanted to keep it simple and clean. I didn’t want just a black and white theme, so I added a pop of glitter and gold to make the design more fun. I worked with a great designer, Tammy of A Loyal Love, and together we created my site. As for the name, Primp &amp; Proper is a play on a Southern saying, prim and proper. I thought the name fit me and what I was blogging about very well.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How do you balance a full-time job and part-time blogging? Any rules of time management that you live by?</strong> Well it definitely isn’t easy, ha! I pretty much consider blogging a second full-time job. I spend about 17+ hours a week on blogging and everything that goes into it. For me, it’s all about managing your time and doing what’s necessary first. Instead of trying to do 10 things at once, I categorize my to-do list in order of importance. That way I never miss a deadline. I also use the Day Designer planner, which I highly recommend, that helps me keep track of my day-to-day and daily tasks. I also color code the important tasks and highlight items once they’re finished. I’m OCD about leaving items unchecked or not highlighted, so it helps motivate me to finish what’s on my list.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without? It really depends on the season.</strong> For now, it’s definitely my H&amp;M tote. I own it in three colors… yes, three. I love it. Molly Sims even complimented me on it and couldn’t believe it wasn’t a designer handbag. I can’t recommend this tote enough. It’s perfect for work or daily use.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have a favorite blog?</strong> It’s so hard to choose just one, but I would say some of the blogs I read daily are Waiting on Martha, Glitter Guide (online magazine), Fashionable Hostess, What Courtney Wore and Sequins &amp; Stripes. I also follow a lot of DC blogs (some of them are even very good friends)! Too many to name, but love them all!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Fashion Week is live and happening! Are you super excited about any designers in particular?</strong> I will admit that this year was the first year I actually sat down and watched some of the shows live. Every year I have to rely on recaps and reviews, simply because Fashion Week is always during busy season at work. This year I watched Tadashi Shoji, Rebecca Minkoff and a few others. I actually did a recap of some of my fave shows here.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>QUICK: Red matte lips or nude shiny gloss?</strong> Easy. Nude shiny gloss. I’m all about the subtle.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"One surprise that has come from blogging that I never expected was how many real life friends I would make through it." <em>&mdash; Kristyn Alysse Royster</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What are your must-have items?</strong> A good tote bag for work, a great pair of heels for work and boots for every day use, a nude gloss and my hot rollers (these are the exact ones I use).

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What camera do you use?</strong> Any tips for taking that perfect photo? I use a Canon SLR. Definitely pay attention to your white balance and ISO (thanks Julien for the tips!!).

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>How long does it typically take to complete a blog post?</strong> It usually depends on the type of post. One of my more simple posts, like Thursday’s 10 Thoughts, takes about an hour from beginning to end. That includes creating the post, editing photos, proofreading, and then scheduling social media posts.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>A more in depth post, like an outfit of the day or recipe, can take anywhere from 3-4 hours total.</strong> That includes taking the outfit photos or cooking the recipe. I usually have one of these types of posts max each week.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>How has social media impacted your blog’s audience?</strong> Social media is HUGE! It’s super important to share your post and interact with your followers/readers. That only helps to grow your social media following, and ultimately your blog readership.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>QUICK: Facebook or Instagram?</strong> Instagram… definitely, Instagram.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> That’s a tough one, because I’ve learned SO many things over the past year. I’m still learning new things each and every day. I guess one “surprise” that has come from blogging that I never expected, was how many real life friends I would make through it. Blogging is about sharing your life on the web. I never thought those friends I connected with via Twitter or Facebook, would turn out to be good friends I hang out with all the time. It has been a very nice surprise!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>If your sister was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of advice you would give her?</strong> Oh gosh… I feel like I could talk about this question for hours. Simply because I knew nothing when I started my blog. Knew absolutely nothing. I’ve written a few posts about this and have a few more on the way, but my number one piece of advice is to educate yourself on what all goes into having a blog and on protecting yourself. Your blog is a business, so it’s vital you know what all comes along with that.

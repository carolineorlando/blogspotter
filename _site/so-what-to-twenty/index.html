    <p class="p--2 p"><em>She does not let age (or anything) get in the way of her fabulousness. <strong>Glenda Harrison</strong> says <strong>So What to Twenty!</strong> Every age group should be represented in the blogosphere, and she brings us fashion and style from a 40+ perspective. Educated at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, she has held many positions in the industry that she is so passionate about. She believes that personal style plays a large role in being your personal best and we agree!</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Because your blog is fashion and style from a 40+ perspective, do you feel that you have more knowledge and experience under your fabulous belt?</strong> I don’t feel I have more experience in blogging since I just began in June 2013. I do, however, believe that I bring a bit more knowledge to the table about the fashion industry as a whole. With many bloggers, it is about the clothes. Don’t get me wrong, I love clothing, but So What to Twenty is more about personal style and the important role it plays in being your personal best.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>Besides the above, what else makes you different from other fashion bloggers?</strong> My educational experience from the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising has played a very important role in my love for the industry. I graduated from FIDM in 1986 with a degree in Marketing &amp; Merchandising. In addition, I have worked in many aspects of the fashion industry from personal stylist to a Fashion &amp; Style columnist for a weekly newspaper.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>What made you start blogging in the first place?</strong> I began as a way to release tension from a very stressful situation I was in. I find writing and writing about style very therapeutic.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Was it difficult to get your blog up and running?</strong> No, it wasn’t difficult to launch it at all. I have the time to work on it, and a tech-savvy husband.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What has been your biggest challenge so far?</strong> My biggest challenge has been gaining the audience. I want the public to trust that I’ll have interesting content.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>How did you come up with the sassy name for your blog?</strong> Thank you for asking this question. Well, first of all let me begin by stating that it is in no way a slight to younger women. So What to Twenty is saying… I am still viable, I can still rock a look, I am still beautiful in spite of what society tries to say about women of a certain age… so, So What to Twenty! Understand? It is more of a mantra to women who have been seasoned with time.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I thoroughly enjoy shopping at vintage boutiques, as well as non-descript shops that are off the beaten path. Also, I am an eBay fanatic. But for more mainstream shopping, I LOVE the world market, the vintage feel of Anthropologie. I like these places because I don’t have the fear of seeing myself coming and going. I like individuality.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"I am still viable, I can still rock a look, I am still beautiful in spite of what society tries to say about women of a certain age... so, So What to Twenty!" <em>&mdash; Glenda Harrison</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never replace?</strong> I have jewelry that I inherited from my mother and maternal grandmother that is irreplaceable and holds such precious memories for me. Also, when I was 17, I fell in love with a pair of chocolate leather riding boots by Marc Alpert of Italy. To earn the money for them, I wrote an essay to my father explaining how I would cherish them forever. I still have them and blogged about them in a post called Equestrian Legacy.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Where do you find style inspiration?</strong> I am greatly influenced by the 1950s era. Actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Kate Hepburn, Grace Kelly and First lady Jackie Onassis influence me. Overall, my mood and temperament, the California lifestyle are all some of my style inspirations.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I like to say that I shop for items that have no expiration date. My style is Classic + a touch of Boho + a little quirk. The base of my wardrobe mostly consists of great classic pieces, but I enjoy mixing my classics with bohemian influences and always a touch of quirk. It just makes the look for interesting.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers and why?</strong> That is tough to answer because every year such fantastic new designers hit the scene. I’ll have to say that my number ones are: Michael Kors, Carolina Herrera, Tracy Reese, Marni, Ralph Lauren and Chloe. I adore these designers the most because they best fit my personal style that I mentioned above.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> PATIENCE!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?</strong> Those who follow So What to Twenty will know that I have a true passion for the fashion industry as a whole. I truly hope that this message is being conveyed. I also hope that people take that there is a big difference in BEING IN STYLE verses HAVING STYLE. The latter is what I strive toward. I won’t run out and purchase the latest trends. What I do work toward is creating a perfectly curated wardrobe that is built to fit my style.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Do you feel that your blog is targeted only to women your age, or do you think anyone could benefit from your posts?</strong> No, not at all. I believe that So What to Twenty is for ALL women, regardless of age, for the simple fact, it is not all about fashion and more about style. There is a difference. There is a quote that best sums it up – Fashion fades by style is eternal.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers of any age?</strong> I’m not sure I’m in the position to give advice for blogging since I am still finding my way. But ask me anything about style and fashion and I can at least point you in the right direction… {wink}

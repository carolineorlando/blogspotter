    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I started in January 2013 because I was working with fashion bloggers on account of my professional role. I wanted to better understand what they do and how they do it. I wanted to have the same challenges they did so I could find ways to overcome those challenges professionally. What surprised me, however, was that I LOVED doing it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Colleagues of mine came up with the name “Bethanimal” years ago and I’ve always had a thing for animal print so I played a little word chemistry and came up with Bethanimal Print.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>With a busy lifestyle, how do you find time to blog?</strong> When I am not sleeping, I am working. I get energized by the time spent on my blog. It never seems like work to me. The day it starts to feel like work to me (or to my husband who takes my photos) we will call it a day.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> My outfit posts take 2.5 hours and my workout posts are more in depth, so those take about 3.5 - 4 hours, plus I’m sore for several days afterward.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>When you started BethAnimalPrint, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original ideal?</strong> My priority was to learn what responsibilities a fashion blogger has and I have a better idea of that now. At this point, I’m just doing it because it brings a lot of joy to my life by giving me the opportunity to express myself and build community.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p">Now that I am familiar with the landscape, my goals have expanded and I want to help women, especially other moms, find pieces that work for their lifestyles and budgets. I hope to inspire at least one person to feel confident with their existing wardrobe. Chances are that most women have some fun, eclectic pieces in their closet which can be repurposed for new life.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Why did you want to blog about fashion and fitness?</strong> Both to learn more about the industry and to appease my Facebook friends who would post “where did you get that?” or “what is your workout routine?” on my photos. Granted, most of them don’t care. :)

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"If you don't love it, don't do it. It's a lot of work and a thankless endeavor." <em>&mdash; Bethann Wagner</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Ever-evolving. Right now it is feminine but utilitarian. I’m at this point in my life where clothes need it to be functional so I can chase my 2-year-old when she tries to run toward traffic. The feminine part comes from having my daughter as well. I used to scoff at full skirts and pink, but now I get it. They are simply whimsical.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?</strong> I transformed my receiving blankets in to skirts, dresses and hats when I was a toddler. We didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up, so I updated hand-me-downs from friends and family with new buttons or a more modern neckline.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p">I studied Fashion Merchandising in college and am totally interested in most aspects of the industry. Right now I am working with fashion vloggers and brands at YouTube.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process?</strong> Sure, I find new products on Twitter or Pinterest and new influencers on Instagram weekly. All of that plays a role in how my own style will evolve and how much time I have to post… Instagram can take hours out of my week!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I would have started much earlier. Someone close to me once said “it is really difficult to be the best when you are playing catch up” and that resonated with me because the competitive side of me wants to be really good at this even though the rest of me would do this even if nobody read it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> The SF fashion blogging community is quite welcoming and I’ve been fortunate to make a few strong relationship with successful and admirable women from blogging. I never knew I could build community this way.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Besides animal print, what are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> I love any color that makes an impact, yellow and cobalt are my favorite right now.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Are there certain pieces or looks that feel very you?</strong> A bitchin’ moto jacket. I am trying to convince my husband to bless me pulling the trigger on a black one (it’s absurdly overpriced). They immediately make any outfit so much cooler.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--18 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Thank you so much for reading! I want this to be inspirational to you no matter what stage of life you are in and I hope this blog empowers you to wear and do anything you want.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--19 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> If you don’t love it, don’t do it. It’s a lot of work and a thankless endeavor.

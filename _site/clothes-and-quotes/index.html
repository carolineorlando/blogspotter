    <p class="p--2 p"><em>Like many personal style bloggers, she inspires through her outfit choices. But <strong>Shannon Rice</strong> of **Clothes and Quotes **takes it one step further by adding some encouraging words as well. Her aim is to tell you how she feels while skipping the dramatic details. Her notebook of wisdom comes in handy, as she includes a quote with each post.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I was on the phone with my mom one day and we were talking about Pinterest and she mentioned how the majority of my pins are just “clothes and quotes”. As soon as she said it I knew it was perfect because it kind of embodied what I wanted my blog to be about at the time.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>Why did you want to include a quote with each of your personal style posts?</strong> I’ve kept a notebook of quotes I loved for the past 10 years on top of all the quotes I’ve written in my journals through the years and I always wondered what I could possibly do with them all. So when I started my blog I thought it was a good idea to put a little focus on my love for quotes by ending each post with one. I try to find one that either relates to my post or to my mood when I write the post. It’s kind of a way to tell the readers I how I’m feeling each day without going into dramatic details.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I originally started blogging in 2012, but I just wasn’t committed. I knew it was something I wanted to do, but I wasn’t putting the effort in and I wasn’t proud of what I had developed. So I took a break, finished school and decided to start all over. I started Clothes &amp; Quotes in May of 2013.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Do you feel that blogging has been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> I do, if not just for the personal accomplishment of putting myself out there. I’m proud that I’ve been able to stick with it because I really do enjoy it. I think it will pay off in the long run and I’m excited to learn more about blogging and myself.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Casual. I’m a total jeans and blouse kind of girl, always with heels and if I’m able to throw on a leather jacket, I’m definitely going to do so.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>How do you decide which outfits are post-worthy?</strong> Oh gosh, I don’t even know if the outfits I post are post-worthy! In the beginning I was trying to put together outfits that I thought were post-worthy, but it got tiring and wasn’t the point of Clothes &amp; Quotes. I realized the whole point of this blog is to showcase my personal style, not to showcase what I think others want to see or what others were wearing. I still question most outfits because, like I said, I dress very casual, but at the end of the day that is what I like to wear and that is what I’m most comfortable in.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Where do you find style inspiration and your encouraging quotes?</strong> Pinterest, always Pinterest. I have a book full of quotes I’ve collected over the years that came from books and articles I’ve read, songs I’ve loved and just ones I’ve randomly came across, but these days it’s all Pinterest. I kind of wish it wasn’t, but it is.

</p>

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Has your personal style changed at all through the years?</strong> I haven’t been blogging long enough to visually see how my style has changed, but it is one of the things I’m excited to have documented. My style has always been pretty casual, but I now work in an office so over the past few years I’ve really had to add a bit of a more “dressed-up” feel to my casual sense of style.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your closet could you never replace?</strong> I don’t think there is anything that could not be replaced. I’m definitely not a sentimental person when it comes it clothes, but the one item I could never not have is a leather jacket. One day I hope to have a budget that allows me to invest in a really nice leather jacket which I can totally imagine will be irreplaceable.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What are your most-loved color and texture combinations?</strong> I love an all-black ensemble. It just never gets old and can be worn on most occasions. Texture wise I’m going to have to go with leather and lace. I love the contrast of the tough leather mixed with the feminine lace.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> The coolest thing that has happened to me since blogging I think it finding my sense of creativity and craving inspiration. I never thought of myself as a creative person, but since I started blogging and constantly looking at other blogs it definitely gets my creative juices flowing and that really excites me.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>You have always loved writing and fashion. Are you interested in any other aspects of the industry?</strong> Yes, I have always loved fashion and writing. Writing prior to fashion, but the two of them together is just kind of ideal. I’d love to be involved in any aspect of the industry that would allow me to indulge in both of my passions. It would obviously be an ideal scenario.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Do you have any future plans for your blog?</strong> At this point, I just really want to focus on building my blog to something that fully represents me and something that I am proud of. Of course I have big dreams of what can come of it, but I’m trying not to get ahead of myself.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in the lives/style of other bloggers. I mean these girls have serious style and it’s hard not to compare, but I want my readers to feel comfortable just being themselves. I hope they can look at my pictures and my style and see that it is nothing fancy, but it’s me. I hope they can see that as long as they are comfortable in what they are wearing and they feel confident then that is all that matters.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion writers/personal style bloggers?</strong> Definitely do it! It really is hard work, but there are so many great people to meet and amazing opportunities to be had that all the work will be worth it. And of course, be yourself! As long as you are true, people will follow and support you!

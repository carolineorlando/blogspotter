    <p class="p--2 p"><em>The fashionable life of <strong>Maria</strong>, the busy lady behind <strong>Dainty and Decadent</strong>, has changed greatly since she became a mommy. Now, she dresses for comfort and running around, but you’ll never catch her looking boring. A scroll through her diligent posts shows laidback looks, as well as office chic ensembles ready for work days as an attorney. Visit Dainty and Decadent for a little bit of everything, including snaps of her sweet son Lucas. Learn more about Maria through Blogspotter.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>You started blogging as a way to document the end of your twenties. Were there any other reasons you started? What made you continue?</strong> I guess to hold me accountable. That’s a strange way of putting it but I found myself in a rut and thought if I starting documenting my life, outfits, etc., I wouldn’t get so lazy. Now, that I’m a mom, I want to document every aspect of my son’s life so I never forget these moments. So I continue blogging to document this awesome time right now and because I love connecting with readers.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> The name, honestly, came about because I liked both words. I wish there was a deeper reason!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>Has being a mommy changed your fashion choices at all?</strong> Absolutely! I get dressed before my son wakes up so I always choose to wear something comfortable because I know as soon as he’s up, I’m going to be running around.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would say classic and comfortable. Sometimes people associate the word comfortable with boring but I think, at least for myself, if I’m not comfortable, I’m not going to feel great which will translate into whatever I’m wearing.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Tory Burch flats, Maxi Dress, Boyfriend Cardigan, Louis Vuitton Speedy, Chanel Flap (totally not practical but it’s my love!)

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What are your most-loved color and texture combinations?</strong> Black and White. Simple and Classic.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>As an attorney, does your work style differ from your normal, everyday style?</strong> My normal, everyday style is very relaxed versus what I wear to work which is usually a pencil skirt and top. You never know if there’s going to be an emergency hearing so I always dress for work with that in mind and know that I can throw a blazer on and be ready to go.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"My advice is to try not to be like anyone else but yourself." <em>&mdash; Maria</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> I had my son! I loved blogging my pregnancy outfits and sometimes go back through my archives just to see my massive preggo belly!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What was the process of starting your blog like?</strong> Thankfully, my husband is supportive and tech savvy. He very much built the blog for me and taught me how to manage it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Diligence. Sometimes I skip days here and there in posting but then I get the urge to want to do 5 posts in a row. I just love blogging and getting inspiration from others too.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Tell us about the Modcloth Uniquely You campaign and what that entailed. Have you been involved in any similar projects?</strong> The Modcloth Uniquely You campaign was so much fun because it was like I got to shop and create my perfect outfit! I’ve never been involved with another project like that before but I certainly will enjoy the opportunity to get to do it again.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Do you have any plans for your blog’s future?</strong> My life is certainly changing (for the best) and so I hope to share more about being a working mother, sharing outfit ideas, and, of course, my little fashionable son, Lucas.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring mommy bloggers?</strong> Mommy blogs are definitely one of my favorites to read and I love when mommy bloggers are honest. My advice is to try not to be like anyone else but yourself.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long ago did you start What Would Kiki Wear?</strong> I started consistently posting personal style photos in May of 2013. Before that, What Would Kiki Wear was a Tumblr blog comprised of fashion photography, outfit inspirations, and editorials. While it worked as a great inspiration board, I realized it would be easier to create the looks I envisioned myself instead of trying to find them online. That is when I decided to share my own styling posts and begin writing.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you choose the name for your blog?</strong> If I only knew how many times I would get asked this question when this started… the name came about when my sister and I had the brilliant idea to dye my (at the time) brunette hair blonde. I wasn’t sure if I would like it so we figured temporary color was the obvious answer. One trip to CVS and a box of hair dye later I was yes, still a brunette. Somehow in this process she pretended to be a European hairstylist saying, “Work that blonde hair Kiki.” That’s how What Would Kiki Wear started… from a box of CVS hair dye as ironic as that is.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You post a lot of personal style. What is your process of choosing outfits?</strong> My personal style posts center around a trend or a specific piece. I always have a vision of what I want the look to be but I usually don’t have all the pieces planned until minutes before the shoot. Fashion should come naturally and should never feel forced so I don’t put too much time into planning outfits. Don’t get me wrong; I do have those days where I’m standing in my completely full walk in closet so frustrated because I have “nothing to wear.” I don’t plan my ootd posts at all because to me that would defeat the purpose. Outfit of the day posts are supposed to convey a level of realism, I want to show my readers what I would wear running around on the weekend.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My personal style is classic glamour with a touch of California inspired boho chic.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What are some other subjects that you blog about?</strong> I recently did a beauty post about my favorite eye makeup products, which was something fun and different to blog about. I occasionally write about a great marketing campaign, some of my favorite items and of course a fashion week recap. I always try to add in tips on how to style different pieces. I absolutely love styling people so this is my way to give advice through my blog.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What is your main source of fashion inspiration?</strong> When I was about ten I started going through fashion magazines and tearing out ad campaigns and editorials that I liked. I saved them all in a binder that was overflowing with different magazine pages. Eventually the paper pages turned into webpages and my binder upgraded to Pinterest and Tumblr. To this day most of my inspiration comes from fashion editorials and ad campaigns. They are over the top enough that you can find ways to tone it down and make it your own.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Basics with standout accessories, or bold pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> It depends on the look you’re going for! Basics with standout accessories is definitely a minimalistic chic, less is more look. When I want the clothes to speak for themselves, I break out the bold pieces with my classic jewelry. For me, it’s a balance between the two.

</p>

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What are your most-loved color or texture combinations?</strong> There’s nothing I love more a fabulous fur statement jacket. I also love a little leopard here and there. These are both things that can be a recipe for disaster but perfection when done right.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Which pieces do you find yourself wearing over and over?</strong> I’m really into classic handbags. Right now you’ll see me carrying my black quilted Chanel but if not that, it’s my Louis Vuitton Speedy.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you gravitate more toward neutrals or bright hues?</strong> It changes with my mood! If I wear a bright bottom, I usually pair it with a black or more subdued top. I guess you could say I’m a combination of the two but very rarely will you see me in bright hues from head to toe.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What trends are you excited to try this spring?</strong> I am so excited for pleated skirts, crop tops (done right) and mules! It’s such a refreshing feel. I’m looking forward to a more feminine and flirty look this spring.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I try to shop around and buy items from a variety of places but I do have a few favorites. Alice+Olivia is great for the perfect mix of classic and trendy. The sizes run small and you know you’re getting high quality pieces. Juicy Couture has a lot of items that fit me without alterations, which is always convenient for last minute shopping. You can’t really go wrong with Nordstrom, Neimans, and Barneys. Boutiques are great for more unique pieces that you don’t want everyone else to have.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>How do you think your blog stands out from other fashion blogs?</strong> I try not to compare myself to other fashion blogs. I define my personal style by what I’m feeling inspired by that day. I did my “rock and roll” post in denim cut offs, and a leather jacket and the week before I was shooting in a white lace sundress and an oversized navy sunhat. I definitely have a wide range of looks but I try not to make my blog just about me. I want my readers to apply what I’m conveying to their personal style and make it their own.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I want to come across as someone my readers feel comfortable reaching out to for styling advice. I hope to give people fashion and styling tips that help them feel more confident about themselves. I always stress that a style that looks good on someone else may not be the style that looks best on you and vice versa. It is so important to figure out what works best for you and not compare yourself to how it looks on someone else.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion and personal style bloggers?</strong> You probably want to start a fashion blog because it’s what you love. Regardless if you have one reader or one million readers, it is so important to stay true to yourself and never lose sight of the reason you started a blog in the first place.

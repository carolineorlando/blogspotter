    <div class="interview-teaser"><p><strong>Hannah Hawkshaw</strong> of <strong>Hawk Eye View</strong> may be the most self-confident, ambitious, and sophisticated 16-year-old we’ve ever chatted with. It’s evident that she’s absolutely fearless, (her advice to a newbie blogger: “don’t be frightened – fear nothing”) which we find is the most admirable trait about her. Along with blogging at Hawk Eye View, (which, by the way, she launched when she was a mere 13 years old) she’s in the process of developing a music career as a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/HannahHawkshaw">singer/songwriter</a>. She loves Louis Vuitton, confesses that if she had $1,500 to blow - it’d be on a Chanel 2.55 Classic Flap Bag, and adores pink. We’re not sure what they’re putting in the water in Ireland - but whatever it is, we would like some of it! Meet Hannah Hawkshaw of Hawk Eye View with Blogspotter today - you do not want to miss her, now or in the future._</p></div>
    <ol class="interview">
      
      
      
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">You hail from Ireland, your hair is beautiful, and we love the name of your blog. Tell us a little bit about yourself.</p>
        <p class="answer">Thank you so much! Well… I’m a 16 year old fashion blogger born in Manchester, but currently living in Dublin, Ireland. I also happen to be a <a href="http://Soundcloud.com/HannahHawkshaw" target="_blank">singer/songwriter</a>, with music being my first love. I’m crazy in love with the fashion industry and hope to combine my two loves into a career for myself in the near future.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">What’s the weather like in Ireland right now?</p>
        <p class="answer">To be honest, it’s absolutely horrible! I’m not a fan of the Irish climate at the moment, it’s very rainy and grey. However, Dublin hasn’t been as bad weather-wise as other parts of the country so I’m trying to keep my spirits high by keeping a smile on my face!</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">What made you decide to launch Hawk Eye View? How long have you been blogging for?</p>
        <p class="answer">It was a very spur-of-the-moment decision, actually. I came across blogging during a very difficult time in my life when I was just 13 and suffering with long term illness and blogging soon became the perfect outlet for me. I had no idea that it would become such a monumental part of my life and aid my recovery as it did! I established my blog in late 2010, but have only been blogging seriously since just last year.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Your celebrity doppelganger is Amy Adams - in some of your photos you look like you could be twins! Do you get this a lot?</p>
        <p class="answer">Really?! Wow, thank you! I’ve actually never gotten that before, but I’m so flattered that you think that.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Tell us about the most awesome experience you’ve had that was only possible because of your blog.</p>
        <p class="answer">Hmm, that’s a tough one, blogging has led me to so many wonderful opportunities. However, recently, I was invited over to Berlin for The STYLIGHT Fashion Blogger Awards which was huge for me. I got to meet so many influential people and some of my favourite bloggers including Chiara Ferragni and Kristina Bazan. This was such an awesome experience and definitely my favourite so far!</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</p>
        <p class="answer">I read so many blogs on a daily basis that it’s so hard to list them all. However, I really love Kayture. Kristina Bazan has such a chic sense of style that is quite in line with mine, and the fact that she also started her blog in her teens makes her that much more relatable to me, so her blog is always at the top of my list. I’m also an avid reader of BeFassy.net and Viva Luxury.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">How does Irish culture influence your style?</p>
        <p class="answer">The Irish weather in particular greatly influences my style. When the weather is as dull and cold as it has been these past few weeks, it’s tough not to forget about style and just through on a warm knit and sweat pants. It really challenges me on a daily basis, to look good whilst also keeping warm.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote"><span class="quote-content">"Worrying about what others will think will get you nowhere – but believing in yourself and your work will."</span><span class="quote-attribution">&mdash; Hannah Hawkshaw</span></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="question">Who’s your favorite clothing designer?</p>
        <p class="answer">Louis Vuitton. I’ve been a lover of the brand for as long as I can remember, investing in my first Speedy at the tender age of 13. It epitomizes elegance and grace and is a brand which I have forever been in awe of. I also strongly admire Chanel’s classic styles.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Do you have a favorite accessory - something that you wear everyday?</p>
        <p class="answer">I have a few favourite pieces, but not ones I necessarily wear everyday. I like to mix things up on a daily basis but in general, my favourite piece would be my beloved Louis Vuitton Speedy 35. It’s a practical piece, yet one that dresses up any outfit effortlessly and is perfect for every occasion. I’m also currently loving my Daniel Wellington Classic Sheffield Lady watch. It’s such a timeless piece!</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">How would you describe your personal style?</p>
        <p class="answer">I would describe my style as being classic and elegant, yet unafraid of taking a risk. I like to keep things simple whilst also challenging myself to push my own boundaries and to play with different styles.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">If you had $1,500 to spend on a wardrobe piece, what would you spend it on? (and why!)</p>
        <p class="answer">That’s easy – a Chanel 2.55 Classic Flap Bag. I have been lusting over this timeless piece for as long as I can remember!</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Who takes your photos for you, and what kind of camera do you use?</p>
        <p class="answer">My photographer also happens to be my mother, playing two significant roles in my life, however, I also act as photographer on occasions where I am not the subject of the photo. We use a Nikon D3100 which we find to be easy-to-use and practical for events.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Pearl studs or diamond studs?</p>
        <p class="answer">This girl could never choose between pearls and diamonds! After all, if one was to pick, it limits the possibilities…</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Quick question: what’s your favorite color?</p>
        <p class="answer">Pink, definitely pink. I’m such a girly-girl, actually, I’m a real Elle Woods at heart. The funny thing is, I have very few pieces of pink clothing in my wardrobe, something I plan to rectify this summer!</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding Hawk Eye View?</p>
        <p class="answer">Instagram would have to be my favourite social media platform. I definitely think it helps with branding, it’s a brilliant way of giving one’s followers more of an insight into your personal life. I love sharing more casual snaps with my followers and seeing other bloggers’ experiences.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</p>
        <p class="answer">Self-confidence. Before I started my blog, I had very low self-esteem. Even something as simple as shooting an outfit in public has been incredibly helpful to me on a personal level. As well as that, the feedback and support I have received has been amazing, and has encouraged me to have faith and believe more in myself.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p class="question">Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</p>
        <p class="answer">Don’t be frightened – Fear nothing. I was absolutely terrified of what my peers would think of my blog. For the first year and a half, nobody but my immediate family knew it even existed - not even my best friends. However, when I eventually plucked up the courage to tell people about it, it was the best decision I have ever made, and the journey I have had since doing so has been better than I could have ever imagined. Worrying about what others will think will get you nowhere – but believing in yourself and your work will.</p>

    <p class="p--2 p"><em>Uprooting her life from London to Singapore has brought a lot of change in fashion inspiration for blogger <strong>Andrea Cheong</strong>. <strong>The Haute Heel</strong> is a three year-old fashion blog filled with London inspiration, Singapore scenery, and fascinating stories from the life of this gorgeous, dark-haired fashion blogger. Blogspotter is obsessed with the way Cheong pairs clothing and accessories. Also, how gorgeous are her Singapore-based pictures? We want to visit. Check out Blogspotter’s conversation with Andrea of The Haute Heel.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How did you break into blogging?</strong> I started like most fashion bloggers, as a follower of some really great blogs and it transitioned into a desire for a creative outlet. I studied History of Art which is really theoretical, so I wanted to do something practical like styling.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> The Haute Heel is three years old, I started it during my first summer of university.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>Do you blog full-time, or is it just a hobby right now?</strong> It’s a hobby that I really enjoy. I try to prioritize it whenever I have the free time but I have a full time job now that I have graduated.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You’ve switched up your style quite a bit. What was the reason for the shift?</strong> Part of it came with a huge lifestyle change. Moving to Singapore from London meant a lot of alterations to my style and wardrobe. I started with purging colour from my new purchases, everything was white, black, grey or red. Now I am more settled in my new city I feel as if a return to colour is due.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>We all know the saying: a photo speaks a thousand words. What’s the key to taking a good photo?</strong> I take photos as part of my job now, so I always say great lighting and knowing how to smile. A lot of people find smiling really awkward (me in particular) because I had monstrous teeth and braces as a child. My friends always tease me because I look really serious in my blog photos.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Does living in London (a fashion mecca!) have a huge impact on your personal style?</strong> I was in London for eighteen years and it definitely did. Even the type of designers I was drawn to influenced my style. I loved layers, nudes, sparkly and sheer things as well as very classic cuts. London has a great sense of individualism and the best shopping ever, so I was never really hesitant to try out new combinations or looks.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What are a few of your favorite blogs? Where do you look for inspiration?</strong> I am totally in love with Jessica Stein of Tuula’s style. I am addicted to Instagram for my fashion inspiration, it has a great sense of real- time and really represents the zeitgeist of youth.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"I have always told my friends, if you are going to start, don’t give up after two months." <em>&mdash; Andrea Cheong</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Nail polish: what is your safety it-always-works color? (Brand? Color name?)</strong> Deborah Lippmann has really beautiful and unique colours but right now I am all about the nudes. Their shade ‘Naked’ is my staple favourite. As for manicures, soft gel is the only way to go. I love a good French manicure so for DIY, Incoco do the best nail foils that last for two weeks and actually strengthened my nails.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong> Living in another city, reunited with my dog Gatsby, and my boyfriend.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>If your best friend was about to start her own fashion blog, what would be one piece of must-have advice you’d give her?</strong> I have always told my friends, if you are going to start, don’t give up after two months.

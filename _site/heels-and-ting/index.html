    <p class="p--2 p"><em>The face behind the scarf and shades, <strong>Noor</strong> of <strong>Heels &amp; ting</strong> is inspired by music and it shows. For her, an outfit that is floaty and soft comes only from listening to a sweet, mellow rhythm. Catch her decked out in leather, and she’s been tuning in to rock. Either way, her looks are effortlessly chic. Aside from fashion, she is a skincare fanatic and loves to showcase a bold lip. Get to know Noor. Her style is like that of the coolest girl you know, except cooler.</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Your personal style photographs are beautiful. Who takes them?</strong> Thank you, there are actually a few people who take my photos. It’s mainly my lovely friend Sheerin, but sometimes I’ll even have my niece Lilly take them. I also have some talented photographer friends, like my boy Ricky or my girl Raqeebah who have taken photos for the blog before.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How do you decide on so many different locations and varying poses?</strong> Usually when I’m about to take photos, I have plans to hang out with friends or whatever after so on the drive to wherever I’m going, we just kinda check out the area and if we see a cool spot we pull over and shoot. As for poses, I just kind of stand there mostly haha.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Minimal, and a little grungy. I also like to think it’s low-key Parisian chic.

      </aside>
      

      

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Do you find yourself gravitating more toward neutrals or bright, bold hues?</strong> Probably more toward neutrals. If I’m wearing color it’s usually very muted or a pastel shade.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>You are always photographed in sunglasses. Is that kind of your signature?</strong> I guess it kinda became my signature. I live in Florida, so when I’m being photographed it’s usually extremely sunny. It’s always sunny here, even when it’s raining.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>How do you decide on a corresponding song to go with all of your posts?</strong> Sometimes when we’re shooting, the location will make me think of a song. Other times it’s just a song I’m listening to on loop at that particular time.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>You also do the occasional beauty-related post. Do you consider yourself somewhat of a beauty connoisseur as well?</strong> I think I’m more of a moisturizing connoisseur. I’m definitely into skincare more than cosmetics, but I do really love a good lipstick. I have an embarrassingly large lipstick collection.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"In response to 'What has maintaining a blog taught you?' - That taking photos is really hard. And the sun sets way too early." <em>&mdash; Noor</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Who or what is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I think it’s pretty apparent that music is a huge part of my life, and I think it subconsciously inspires my outfits. Like, if I’m listening to Siouxsie and the Banshees when I’m getting ready, you’ll probably catch me in a lot of leather with super strong brows and a red lip. Or if I’m listening to something more mellow like James Blake or Beach House I’ll probably put together more of a monochromatic look. I also really love Emmanuelle Alt’s style, she just always looks so effortless. And Yasmin Sewell is definitely another style inspirations.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What made you start blogging to begin with?</strong> I’ve always been into fashion, and I started following a few fashion blogs when I was about 16 or 17. My sisters and friends would ask me all the time why I didn’t have a blog, and I didn’t really have an answer. Once I was done with undergrad I immediately started pursuing my masters degree, after a couple semesters I decided I needed a break to just relax and enjoy life and that’s when I started my blog.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> Less than a year.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>How has blogging worked out for you so far? Was it a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> It’s actually really fun, so it’s definitely worthwhile. But shortly after I started my blog I got a job as a counselor, which kind of made blogging a little more difficult because I work five days a week, but whenever I think I have time to shoot a look I make it happen.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>How do you feel that your blog stands out from others?</strong> Well for starters, I wear a scarf, so that kind of sets me apart. Also, I incorporate music into all of my posts so it’s more of a combination of music and style rather than just the latter.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen to you, or best feedback you’ve gotten since you started?</strong> A photographer named Langston Hues reached out to me last year to take my photo for a streetstyle book he’s putting together which was pretty cool. And my favorite menswear blog Four-Pins mentioned me as one of their 20 muses of 2013 which is probably the dopest thing that has ever happened to me.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Are you interested in any other areas of fashion?</strong> Menswear. I love taking menswear pieces and making them more feminine.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong>
That taking photos is really hard. And the sun sets way too early.

    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>The Black Barcode</strong> is what <strong>Madeline Smith</strong> defines as a “place to come if you need help picking an outfit out for the next day”. She blogs to provide creative dressing inspiration for her readers, while giving them a sneak peek into her life. We love the glitter and gold scattered about <strong>The Black Barcode</strong> and adore Madeline’s passion for her work. Meet <strong>Madeline</strong> of <strong>The Black Barcode</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us about The Black Barcode.</strong> The Black Barcode is a place to come if you need help picking an outfit out for the next day. It’s to help inspire others to want to get dressed and be creative with what they are wearing. Not only will you find fashion inspiration but also to see the places I’ve been and food I’ve had and things I’ve purchased. It’s an inside look into my life.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you choose the name and color scheme for your blog?</strong> The name for my blog came from a project I did in 11th grade photograph. It was just showing how everyone dresses the way they are told from media, and not having a personal style. Everyone in my school wore leggings, Uggs and Northface jackets; they wore the same thing everyday. So the name “The Black Barcode” is basically a spin from that, barcodes all look the same, and I wanted my blog to show you that you don’t have to fit in with what you are told. I choose the color scheme for my blog because you can never go wrong with a little gold and glitter!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> I find inspiration from other bloggers. I follow a ton of bloggers and check their sites everyday to get inspiration on what is on trend, or ways to style different things. I feel like if they can do it, I can do it, so it inspires me to keep going!

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My personal style is pretty classic; I wear a lot of red white and blue, and try to be as put together as possible.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>QUICK! Heels or flats?</strong> Flats for now! I’m in school and it’s just much easier to go class to class in my favorite Tory Burch Reva flats!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>QUICK! Gelato or ice cream?</strong> Ice Cream! I love making my own at home by adding in caramel sauce or mini M&amp;M’s!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Do you take more cues from street style or runway fashion?</strong> I get more from runway fashion because I can take what’s on the runway and make outfits from current pieces I already own for a much affordable price.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"It takes a lot of time to come up with the finish product, so being organized can save you a lot of time." <em>&mdash; Madeline Smith</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start to finish, including “thinking”, photography, editing, and content writing)</strong> It usually depends on what I’m doing, sometimes I can figure out what I want to post quickly, but others take time, I post every other day so I’ll give myself that time to do everything!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Well it would have to include a J.Crew excursion vest, because I own about 6 of them. I would wear a classic outfit, my Steve Madden riding boots, probably my J.Crew herringbone vest, a soft black long sleeve shirt with dark wash jeans. For jewelry my monogram necklace, gold watch and Kate Spade bow ring!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What has social media done for your blog? What platform has had the biggest impact on your audience growth?</strong> I’m currently only on Instagram (@monobelleprep) and Pinterest (theblackbarcode) and Twitter (@theblackbarcode). I started off on Instagram before ever starting a blog, so Instagram probably has helped connect my follows to my blog.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?</strong> Really anyone that is around that day, so usually my best friend, boyfriend, or sister! I have a Canon T3I and absolutely love it! I wish I were able to take my own photos since I love photography just as much!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> Becoming friends with a lot of other fashion bloggers, and making great connections with people I wouldn’t have without my blog.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> Take photos in different locations. I can still do that, but I wish I had used a variety of different locations in my earlier posts.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> To be organized, and how to plan. It takes a lot of time to come up with the finish product, so being organized can save you a lot of time.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be yourself and use original content.

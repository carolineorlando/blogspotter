    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us about your self-titled blog, Natalia Bosch.</strong> My blog is like a photo diary, a place where I share my personal style, my love for fashion, adventures and basically everything that comes to my mind. I started blogging at a very young age, as I got older my love for fashion grew with me. It wasn’t until I was at my first year of college that I decided to do personal style and outfit’s posts. I was a very insecure girl and the blog somehow helped me to be more confident and embrace who I was.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I’ve being blogging for four years. I started my blog in 2011, when I was sixteen years old.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How did you know it was the right time to launch your blog?</strong> I didn’t. I knew I wanted to have my little corner of inspiration on the web, but I wasn’t sure when was the right time. One thing I’m sure, what motivated me from the beginning to make a blog was the opportunity to share my inspirations and passions.

      <blockquote>"I've learned that building a successful blog takes time and dedication. You really need to engage and be passionate about it." <em>&mdash; Natalia Bosch</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start to finish, including “thinking”, photography, editing, and content writing)</strong> It depends, sometimes I schedule certain days to take the photos other times is spontaneous; but, I always make sure the location is the appropriated for the outfit. Outfits photos take from 30 minutes to a 1-hour depending on the climate, lighting, the place, etc. What really consumes my time is choosing the pictures, editing them, putting together the full post with links and written material. That takes me a 1-hour or more. It all depends on the type of post I’m writing.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>How has social media helped the growth of your blog?</strong> Social media has helped me expand my blog readers. I reach more people through my posts and it helps me engage more with my followers.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you feel that blogging has been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> Definitely, being a blogger has opened many doors for me, opportunities that I never imagined possible. I feel very lucky that my blog, which started as a hobby is now my job. I wouldn’t change it for anything.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?</strong> Most of the time, my Mom takes my pictures, she has become quite the expert, and my closes friends help me too. I use my Cannon Rebel 5ti with a 75-300mm lens, depending on the photo, we change the lenses.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> I’ve learned that building a successful blog takes time and dedication. You really need to engage and be passionate about it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>QUICK! Rounded toe or pointed toe heels?</strong> For sure, pointed toe heels.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I wouldn’t change anything; I have learned and grow so much from this experience and I’m very grateful.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> If you have a passion for something, go for it. Be always yourself and enjoy it.

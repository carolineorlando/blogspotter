    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Smart and stylish, Aleksandra Panic</strong> of <strong>SashaDoll Fashion Closet</strong> started her blog as a way of sharing fashionable bargains with her readers. A financial guru with no prior sartorial experience, she was camera shy at first, but has now blossomed into a style pro. She prefers espresso over cappuccinos and lattes, loves color (jewel tone obsessed!), and cherishes the conversations she’s had with fellow “famous” bloggers. Meet the Toronto based beauty with Blogspotter below.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us a little bit about SashaDoll Fashion Closet - where did the name come from?</strong> My nickname in my language is Sasha and my family calls me doll. So I thought it sounded cute SashaDoll. Then I just played around with words and came up with SashaDoll Fashion Closet.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I started in June of 2013. Still fairly a newbie!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>When did you make the decision to launch your own blog? Did you just have an “ahha” moment, or did something else motivate you to take the leap?</strong> I have been thinking about it for a long time. I love fashion blogs and always wanted to have one of my own. I often get stopped on the street by girls and women to ask me where I got something or to compliment me. I love sharing my cheap finds (read inexpensive not cheap looking) with everyone. I thought blogging about it would also be a great way to do that. If nothing, at least I will have a diary of outfits in case I have one of those days when I don’t have any inspiration of what to wear, haha. Once I verbalized it out loud, it had to happen.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You work in the financial industry but you pose like a pro! Do you have any prior fashion industry experience?</strong> None at all. But thank you for the compliment. If you look at my pictures in the beginning you will notice that I wore a lot of sunglasses, I was very shy and uncomfortable in front of the camera (even though it is mostly my husband taking pictures), but over time I worked through my fears and got better at it. Once you learn to relax in front of the camera you become yourself, which is the most beautiful you. You just have to find poses that work for your body shape. Practicing in front of mirror helps but camera sees you differently through the lens. So practice by taking pictures.

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>You move around a lot. Where are you from originally? Do you find a lot of inspiration in your hometown?</strong> I was born in Sarajevo. When the war started I moved and lived in Belgrade, Serbia. I also moved several times in Canada too and now finally (I hope), I am settled in Toronto. I definitely think that my style is influenced by where I am from. I get a lot of feminine inspiration from Serbia (or region in general). Being dressed up at any time of the day, wearing heels even in icy weather, I think comes from my roots. The casual, more urban vibe a lot of my outfits have, is definitely influenced by the culture and my life in Canada. I believe it to be a great mix.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>You wear color so well. Any tips for pulling off brights/neons?</strong> Make sure you pick the shade that works for your skin tone. There may be different shades of neon pink, or yellow, or any other neon colour out there, and you can find the one right for you. If you really don’t feel that any of them go very well with your skin tone, then wear it away from your face. Wear the colour in skirts, pants, accessories. Most people look great in bright colours. We just have to get over the fear that we may stand out too much. You look brighter and happier in happy colours and for sure you leave others feeling that way too.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory in your closet?</strong> It used to be my XL hoop earrings. Now I am not sure. Do shoes count?

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"If you don't feel like dressing up too much but still want to look like you put some effort into it, a statement necklace is a great way to do it." <em>&mdash; Aleksandra Panic</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>QUICK! Who is your favorite designer?</strong> Shoes: Sophia Webster. Clothes: Dolce &amp; Gabbana (especially their last collection) and Zara. I have also fallen in love with Peter Pilotto! Amazing prints and shapes!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Jewel tones or neutrals?</strong> I love colour so jewel tones.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Black or navy?</strong> Oh that’s hard. I’ll go with black.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Latte or cappuccino?</strong> Espresso, haha! Ok, cappuccino it is.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What are your thoughts on blazers?</strong> I am a huge fan. Even though I have a hard time finding ones that fit my body shape, I love them. You can dress them up or down, wear them over dresses. They are one of those pieces of clothing in your closet that will be used over and over again. It is a must for any woman. You should have at least three: at least one black one, one in either navy, gray, white or tan colour (second neutral) and one in a bright colour.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>How are you feeling about the “Statement Piece” (jewelry) trend?</strong> I love jewellery in general. You can spruce up any outfit by adding one of those amazing statement necklaces or bracelets. In the summer especially, I love to wear a plain t-shirt, heels, jeans and to dress it up, I add statement necklace. If you don’t feel like dressing up too much but still want to look like you put some effort into it, this is a great way to do it. Also, if you are not feeling great about your body and want the attention at your face, what a better way to do it then to put on some great earrings or a necklace.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Do you find that social media has been an important factor with respect to your blog’s growth?</strong> I’m still learning about it. But I can definitely say that it is a huge part of being a blogger.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging?</strong> There has to be a few. Definitely being approached for collaboration is a compliment, but receiving kind emails and notes from people all over the world, is more important. I also got to speak (email) with some of my favourite bloggers who have answered many of my questions when I was just starting. It was great to see that someone famous who receives hundreds of emails and messages daily, took the time to answer my questions and send me off with kind words into the blogosphere.

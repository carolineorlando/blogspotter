    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Mindy Ramaker</strong> of <strong>Arc Line Space Dot</strong> needed an outlet for her design inspirations, thoughts and personal style. Her blog is just that, as well as an engaging snapshot of her daily life. Her personal style is a delightful balance of functional and fun, and serves as a guide for sophisticated chic.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I started Arc Line Space Dot at the very beginning of this year. I needed something outside of my day-job to help me stay creative and focused on writing and photography. Blogging helped me do all of that!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> The name comes from one of my favorite authors, Aimee Bender. In her book The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake, the main character says, “I watched as she added a question mark at the end. Arc, line, space, dot.” It seemed like a really fitting name for my blog because I’m always asking questions and think it’s a great way to learn. I also love how her description breaks down something as simple as a question mark into an even more pure form of geometric shapes. In that sense it really captures my love for minimalism.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How do you decide what to post about?</strong> I try to write about a variety of things from fashion to films to food – and it’s always a balance between what’s going on my head and what’s actually interesting to read about. One thing I try to be conscious about when writing is not pushing products too much. I love shopping, but I don’t think people need buy lots of stuff in order to look or feel great. So I try to mix it up and write about both new and old or borrowed clothes as well as all the other kinds of things we can do to be happy.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Functional, but fun. Casual, but chic. Basic, but beautiful. I really believe the most stylish things are simple.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Black, white and pastels are my favorites – but with summer fast approaching, white is my go-to. I always feel polished and bright in pure white!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Where are your go-to places to shop and why?</strong> I love Shopbop because they have amazing lookbooks; they also carry my favorite brands, like Alexander Wang, Vince, Club Monaco, Theory, and so many more. They also have free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members. You can’t beat it!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Who are your favorite designers, clothing and otherwise, and why do they inspire you?</strong> I have a special place in my heart for Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Kenzo and Opening Ceremony. My boss, the filmmaker David Lynch, was apparently a big influence for their latest collection - so they asked him to design the runway for the Fall/Winter 2014 show. It was such a joy to get to work with them – and of course, all of their designs are so fresh and fun.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Don't worry about numbers. When I first started blogging, I was obsessed with the number of followers or page visits I was getting. But those kinds of markers only bring me fleeting satisfaction." <em>&mdash; Mindy Ramaker</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I love Scandinavian design. They have the best furniture, typography and over-all design sense, which I try to apply to my wardrobe and my life – sometimes more successfully than others! But Scandinavian design is definitely my biggest source of inspiration. It’s functional with a touch of grace.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My favorite item is a grey hooded Vince sweater jacket that I got for a steal at Nordstrom Rack. I’ve had it for close to four years, and with the help of a sweater comb, it looks as good as the day I bought it – even though I throw it on with everything. I probably wear it three to four times a week! If I ever lose or wreck it, after I finish crying, I’ll run out and buy another one. (Luckily Vince continues to make a version of it every year. Fweh!)

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> Too long! I’m a slow writer and a perfectionist, which isn’t a good combination. I don’t know how many times I’ve annoyed my boyfriend by saying, “just 15 more minutes and then I’ll be done,” only to still be working on a post an hour later.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Do you take your own photos, or do you have help?</strong> I do a lot of the photography myself, but for all the outfit pictures, it’s a joint effort with my boyfriend, Michael. It’s a bit of an unusual process, but we make it work and I’m utterly grateful to him for all the time and effort he puts into my blog. If it weren’t for him, the blog wouldn’t even be possible.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> You have to enjoy the doing. We really can’t control how our work is received so you have to enjoy doing the work itself. That’s something my boss has always said and the blog has really taught me how practice it. I also think people can tell when something is genuine, so the more you enjoy what you are writing or wearing, the more other people will too!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Aside from this interview!? Getting to know really smart, creative women from all around the world has by far been the coolest part of blogging. It’s amazing how many talented people there are out there.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> Instagram and Bloglovin are really important in my blogging process. They are both great ways to connect with other bloggers and drive traffic to your actual blog. Without Instagram or Bloglovin, and now Blogspotter, I’m not sure how we’d find each other!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Don’t worry about numbers. When I first started blogging, I was obsessed with the number of followers or page visits I was getting. But those kinds of markers only bring me fleeting satisfaction. I think it’s more fulfilling to focus on engaging readers in conversation and building relationships. It makes all the work worth it and so much more fun!

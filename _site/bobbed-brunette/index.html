    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Tabitha Rodriguez</strong> is the brains &amp; beauty behind <strong>The Bobbed Brunette</strong>, a Northern Virginia based style blog, drizzled with a touch of classic-American style. The self-proclaimed beauty junkie is never without bold brows and bright red lips. By “inspiring women through outfits” that “won’t break the bank”, (her favorite brand is H&amp;M) Tabitha connects with her readers on a more personal level - and we guarantee you will too.</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>You’re simply stunning - a classic beauty. What made you want to start blogging?</strong> You are too kind! Thank you! I started blogging in hopes to show women that having great style doesn’t always have to mean luxury. It’s personality. Yes, I will admit that I have expensive taste and I love my investment pieces. But not every woman, including myself, can afford designer pieces all the time. I created The Bobbed Brunette to inspire women through outfits and to show them great style doesn’t have to break the bank.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>We love your eyebrows. Do you fill them? What products do you use to achieve such a flawless face?</strong> I do! I’ve used a few different products over the last few months. My favs have been e.l.f. Studio Eye Brow Kit, Anastasia Brow Wiz, and Make Up Forever eyebrow pencil. I also am obsessed with Revlon’s Photoready foundation! It really helps give that “flawless” look.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>What websites or blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> My favorite style blogger is Blair Eadie of Atlantic Pacific. She can do no wrong! I also get inspired by retail stores that come out with seasonal lookbooks. I love to go online and browse through JCrew and H&amp;M’s websites for outfit ideas.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You used to live in NYC! Was the switch hard to NOVA hard? How are you inspired by your new surroundings?</strong> I was born and raised in NYC but I also lived in Florida. Virginia is the perfect median. So no, the switch wasn’t too bad. NOVA is so great because in a short drive north you’re in DC and in a short drive south you’re in Fredericksburg. You get the best of both worlds. It really allows you to experiment with your style without feeling like you’re sticking out and it also provides great variety for photo shoots!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Your photos are so artistic and rich, <a href="http://www.thebobbedbrunette.com/2014/01/foggy-nights.html">we can’t stop staring</a>. Who takes your photos?</strong> My husband, Angel, takes the photos. Photography is a hobby of his so the blog is like our baby.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What camera do you use?</strong> Canon 6D.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite small accessory?</strong> My favorite small accessory right now is the midi ring. I love how you can wear as many as you want and they just look so cool!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Try not to get discouraged by your number of followers. It's like having friends - better to have 1 best friend than 10 acquaintances." <em>&mdash; Tabitha Rodriguez</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Your eye makeup always looks amazing. Do you frequent any beauty blogs for tips/advice?</strong> Honestly, I haven’t found a beauty blog (yet!) that I frequent for inspiration. I mostly get my tips and advice from makeup artists on Instagram and YouTube. I also have beauty junkie family members who tell me what to do and what products to buy.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer? (Try! If you could only shop one brand… what would it be?)</strong> Does H&amp;M count? LOL I love that place and if I could only shop one brand it would be H&amp;M. They’re trendy and affordable, my two favorite things!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Ugh, this is tough! The diva in me wants to say if I can only wear one outfit I’m going to look good! Something all black, under the knee, plunging neckline, and pointy toed shoes. In reality I’ll probably end up in high rise skinny jeans, tucked in collar shirt, and a statement necklace. Oh, and a red lip of course!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What are your thoughts on the “Statement Necklace” trend?</strong> LOVE! Honestly, it’s my favorite piece of jewelry. It can make the most boring outfit into something “blog worthy”. They can be worn with everything!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Plaid or stripes?</strong> Plaid!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding The Bobbed Brunette?</strong> Definitely Instagram. Those hash tags are the best! It really helps with branding because it gives a face (or selfie) to the name.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “People will stare. Make it worth their while.” –Harry Winston

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Blog about what you love and you’ll never run out of things to say! Try not to get discouraged by your number of followers. It’s like having friends - better to have 1 best friend than 10 acquaintances.

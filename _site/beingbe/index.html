    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>BreAnne Elenburg</strong> is the Texan beauty behind <strong>BEING/BE</strong>. She’s rather new to the blogging world (she officially started blogging August 2014) but she’s getting the hang of it rather quickly: she’s already amassed loyal a following and learned a thing or two. Meet <strong>BreAnne</strong> of <strong>BEING/BE</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us a little bit about BEING/BE.</strong> I started my blog to showcase my passion for fashion. The greatest way I know to express myself is through fashion and the more I learn about the industry the more I evolve; my personality, my mood, and sometimes a coffee and/or wine spill is evident through my outfit. After countless hours of following amazing fashion bloggers I decided to start my own to share my creativity in hopes that people will see that style, just like the little ole word “be”, is limitless.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>We’re so curious: how did you come up with the name “BEING/BE”?</strong> If you were to look up the word “be” in the dictionary, the definition would bore you with the simplicity and vagueness of it. But then again how do you sum up the magnitude of the word? In my opinion, BE is to exist, it’s to take place, to happen or occur, it means to continue or remain as before; BE is whatever you want it to be. That is where the name of the blog came from. I live by a mantra of always being who you are. Well, I’m Being/BE-BreAnne Elenburg.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>When did you officially start blogging?</strong> End of August 2014

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You blog about style and beauty. What’s your favorite thing to blog about?</strong> Definitely style; beauty is a blast, don’t get me wrong, but fashion is always changing and I love the opportunity my followers give me to keep them up to date with the latest trends.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Did you formally study fashion as an undergrad? If not, do you find that you’re able to incorporate what you did study into your blog?</strong> Yes! I was extremely fortunate to study Fashion Merchandising at Texas Christian University.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>QUICK! Hot pink or bright yellow?</strong> Hot pink all the way!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What’s your favorite brand?</strong> Oh wow, this a toughie! It’s hard to say what my favorite brand is because they all have unique qualities about them that I like to add to my wardrobe. BUT- I will say you can normally find me in at least one item from J.Crew or Madewell. However, if we are talking designers, I would definitely have to say YSL!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Be YOU! You can try your best to mimic other bloggers but at the end of the day you want to be yourself." <em>&mdash; BreAnne Bransom Elenburg</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> As I mentioned a bit in why I started my blog, defining my personal style would be impossible. I dress how I feel that particular day and this can range from an all-black ensemble for a simple trip to the grocery store to ripped jeans with a flannel and converse for a night out with my girls. You just simply never know!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite guilty pleasure food?</strong> Popcorn! I could eat popcorn for every meal! Add extra butter and nacho cheese seasoning salt and you have heaven in a bucket!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you have a favorite outfit in your wardrobe? What is it?</strong> My go-to outfit when I’m having just “one of those days” is my most comfortable pair of jeans, a simple top and some type of jacket (usually I go with leather to spice up my life a bit). This outfit is then paired with either flats or pumps, but don’t even try to ask what my favorite pair of shoes is because that is an impossible question!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Let’s talk Texas! What’s your favorite thing about Texas, and the south?</strong>
I love the southern hospitality of living in Texas. Everyone is friendly and I love meeting someone only to feel like I’ve known them my whole life after just five minutes of talking! I also can’t go without mentioning teased hair. Big hair is such a Texas thing and I’m obsessed with it! The bigger the hair the closer to Heaven!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> There are a number of successful bloggers that I keep up with on a daily basis. These women are incredibly inspirational to me and I love how each blog is unique in its own way. I also try to stay on top of major retailers and designers to see up and coming trends. And of course, Pinterest; what girl doesn’t love Pinterest?

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Who takes your photos for you?</strong> Amanda Marie Lackey is my amazing photographer!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Creating a blog has definitely had its ups and downs. It’s not as easy as it looks! Developing your own unique way that is consistent requires you to look into yourself and figure out the way you want to be perceived. I’ve learned that patience is key and I won’t have a billion dedicated followers overnight, as well. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had because it has taught me to be comfortable in my own skin. There is no right or wrong way to be a blogger except to just be myself and enjoy what I do!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The ability to express myself is definitely the most rewarding component of blogging. There is a much deeper level of satisfaction when you can share your passion with the world.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--18 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be YOU! You can try your best to mimic other bloggers but at the end of the day you want to be yourself.

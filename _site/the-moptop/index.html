    <p class="p--2 p"><strong>Tell us about the The Moptop.</strong> The Moptop is my fashion blog that I started my senior year of high school after stumbling upon Free People. I was so inspired by their website and blog that I decided to make one of my own!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>The name is so interesting! How did you come up with it?</strong> I’m a huge fan of The Beatles and my hair is always kind of messy and curly, so I thought The Moptop would be the perfect name!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for? Do you blog full time?</strong> I started my blog December of 2010. I blog as often as I can with school and work. I hope to someday blog full time.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>We love your long, dark hair. How easy is it to maintain your easy-going look?</strong> Thanks! My hair is naturally curly so I think that helps some. But I curl the top pieces that are kind of flat. I don’t brush my hair too often, which sounds weird but I think this helps is stay kind of messy and wavy.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>What brought you to the world of blogging?</strong> It was definitely seeing Free People’s blog and discovering all these people with blogs too. I never knew this was a thing, but I was so inspired by there creativity and outfits that I wanted to be a part of it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Who are a few of your favorite designers?</strong> I don’t really follow high fashion too religiously, which I should probably start doing. But I am always wowed by Anna Sui and Dolce and Gabbana.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What inspires your personal style on a daily basis?</strong> My style icon, Alexa Chung, is always a great inspiration for me. As well as icons of the 60s such as Anna Karina and Bob Dylan. I love the classic styles of the past.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What blogs do you frequent?</strong> Flashes of Style is one of my favorites, I’ve been following Bonnie’s blog for a long time and I love how consistent she is with her style and vintage aesthetic. I also love Natalie Off Duty and Kelli Murray.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"I feel as though people really appreciate reading authentic blogs, it's more interesting. And also, have fun!" <em>&mdash; Tonya Smith</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one pieces from one designer, who would it be?</strong> That’s a hard one. Can I just replace my whole wardrobe with Alexa Chung’s closet? :)

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Gray or grey?</strong> Black.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What is it that makes your blog unique and different from others?</strong> I really try to pick backgrounds that work with my outfit. I try to pick different locations rather than just always standing in front of the same wall or space. It’s almost like a photo shoot every time I take photos for my blog, I really want to work with the feel/vibe of the outfit.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Who takes your photos? And what camera do you use? Do you have any tips for taking great photos?</strong> I usually take the photos myself with my tripod. I have a Canon Rebel t2i and I’m hoping to get a new lens soon! My advice would be just take your time, photography takes practice!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Obviously, first and for most, be true to yourself! I feel as though people really appreciate reading authentic blogs, it’s more interesting. And also, have fun! Try not and take it too seriously all the time… I need to work on that one too!

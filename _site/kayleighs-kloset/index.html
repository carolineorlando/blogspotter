    <p class="p--2 p"><em>She is “A girl with big dreams and an even bigger closet,” and she’s ready to serve up style inspiration. <strong>Kayleigh Adam</strong> of <strong>Kayleigh’s Kloset</strong> is into all things girly and glam. Skirts and femme details are her go-tos, but her looks are also versatile. She started her blog as a visual log of her outfits, and it’s the perfect place to get some ideas for spring!

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I’ve had my blog since August of 2013, but I didn’t really start posting until November 2013. I’ve always wanted to work in the fashion industry in New York City and one summer I decided to start blogging after being told that it gives employers something visual to look at other than a resume. I’ve always loved fashion and dressing up, so sharing my style with the world for my future just seemed like such a perfect fit for me!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name, color scheme, and graphics for your blog?</strong> I struggled with picking a name for some time. Kayleigh’s Kloset was something that one of my Mom’s friends recommended because I have such a large amount of clothes. Spelling “Kloset” with a K was also perfect because my family has always called me “Kay-Kay” and now my blog’s initials are K.K. I love pink, and that should definitely be apparent whenever you visit my blog! So pink was the only color option for me. My logo is gold glitter because gold is my second favorite color. I was obsessed as soon as I learned how to do it on photoshop!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You post mostly personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> I’m very versatile and it mainly depends on my mood. For the most part I’m extremely girly, but I try to make my outfits as glamorous as I possibly can. I’m in college so there can be a preppy feel one day, and I work at Anthropologie so I’ve been adding a lot of Boho-chic elements lately!

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Has your personal style changed throughout the years?</strong> Oh most definitely. When I was in middle school I would wear whatever I wanted, and that wasn’t always a good thing. I’ve gone through a tomboy phase and the t-shirt/nike shorts phase. I like to think that hopefully I’ll look back on how I dress now and be proud of it!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Hmmm that’s a tough one. A year ago I would say basics with bold accessories but now I would say stand out pieces with dainty jewelry! However, I’m all for mixing statement pieces and bold jewelry! It’s always great to see someone being bold and brave with their outfit choices!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Pink anything! Hot pink, light pink, magenta, radiant orchid, all shades honestly. I also love metallics or a simple black and white contrasting outfit. I’d say my favorite pattern would be floral and I love that it’s back this year! Second favorite would be a cute Aztec print on a kimono, skirt or a crop top.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I love Anthropologie because I get to see all of the news items come in and the quality is fabulous. Nordstrom is my go-to department store. Kate Spade and Henri Bendel are my splurge stores! Lulu’s, Shop Hope’s, Tobi, and Boca Leche are my favorite online stores because of their never-ending new arrivals that are always calling my name! My favorite discount stores are Marshalls, Nordstrom Rack, Kate Spade and Tory Burch Outlets and Saks Off Fifth.

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My little yellow Chanel purse that my Mom gave me for my eighteenth birthday. It’s probably my most prized possession. I still get nervous whenever I wear it because I don’t want it to get dirty!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Are there certain looks or pieces that feel very you?</strong> My friends will see a hot pink dress with an open back or a large bow and will send me pictures saying “this dress is so you.” Any dress or skirt that is very girly, flirty and feminine is very “me!”

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you take your own photos or does someone help you?</strong> Recently I’ve been a one-man-show which has been interesting. I’ve grown up with a Grandpa who is a professional photographer and he’ll take pictures if I ask him to, he’s the best! But he lives two hours away so I can’t always go to him for every outfit. So lately I’ve been using a self-timer and camera tripod and I’m (slowly) catching on! It took me a few months to realize that my camera wasn’t even a D-SLR and I just had it replaced! The photography side of things is so new and confusing to me.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> I can usually get a post up fairly quick. Pictures take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes. The writing and linking of a post can take about the same time. I usually plan what I’m going to say in advance whenever I pick out an outfit.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Time management. It’s not easy being a full time student with two jobs and a blog. I’ve learned that pictures are best if they are taken in bulk and ahead of time. I try to take my pictures in the morning before class or on the weekends when I don’t have anything going on. It’s also taught me that anyone can achieve their dreams. I never would’ve thought that my blog would be as successful as it is! It’s a crazy and amazing experience.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Do you have any plans for the future of your blog?</strong> I hope to see it continue to grow. I have quite a few fun collaborations coming up with boutiques and stores. I hope to start doing local collaborations both in Houston and Norman. I’m living in New York City this summer so I can’t wait to being posting around the city! It’s the perfect backdrop.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Never give up on your dream because if you work hard enough you can achieve it. My blog slogan is “A girl with big dreams and an even bigger closet,” and in this year alone I have already fulfilled quite a few of my dreams!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers wanting to reveal what’s in their closets?</strong> There’s no time like the present to get started, but make sure you’re prepared! Make a calendar of when you’re going to post what and don’t be afraid to step out of the box! The only thing that should matter is how you feel about your outfits and posts. Be patient with your blog and befriend other bloggers. The blogging community is filled with tons of amazing people who are always willing to help out beginning bloggers!

    <p class="p--2 p"><em>She may only be 16 years old (yes, you heard that right, 16), but <strong>Caroline Yauck</strong> of <strong>Citrus &amp; Style</strong> has garnered an incredible amount of knowledge and experience pertaining to the world of blogging. Craving a creative outlet and cognizant of her passion for fashion, she launched Citrus &amp; Style just before starting high school. She prefers pink over orange, adores stripes (navy and white, please!), and deeply cherishes the friendships she’s made with other bloggers through Citrus &amp; Style. Get to know the Wisconsin-bred brunette beauty below - and trust us, she’s not going anywhere for a while!</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Citrus &amp; Style is so juicy - and the colors on your blog reflect that! How did you come up with the name?</strong> To be honest, it was kind of a mistake! The word “citrus” was always kind of nostalgic and pretty to me but when I went to register the name, it was already taken. So instead, I opted to add “&amp; Style” and it has oddly been very fitting!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>When did you start blogging?</strong> Believe it or not, I began blogging the summer before my freshman year of high school. I was craving a creative outlet and had always loved fashion and sharing my tips and tricks with others.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>We can’t believe you’re only in high school! It’s quite the accomplishment to have launched your own blog already. Where do you envision your blog in 3 years?</strong> Thank you so much! Blogging has helped me realize my love for collaborating with others and working with brands, so I hope that my blog with grow into a career for me. It has grown so much from where I started and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You’re a big monogram fan! Tell us what you love most about monogrammed goods.</strong> I love how classic and personal monograms are. Adding your initials to an item makes it so unique and special.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Who takes your photos for you?</strong> It kind of depends on where I am but usually my fellow blogger friends do.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Do you have any tips for balancing your school workload, extra curriculars, and blogging? You seem to have it down to a science!</strong> Well thank you! My life is pretty hectic but I would say that you definitely have to make time for the things you are passionate about. For me, I dedicate an hour to blogging everyday and even more time on the weekends. I schedule my posts ahead of time and keep an agenda (Sugar Paper ones are my favorite!) to plan my time out so I can manage it all.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What are some of your favorite blogs to visit for inspiration?</strong> I read so many but my favorites have to be A Piece of Toast, Design Darling and Lemon Stripes. They never fail to amaze me!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"It's difficult to keep your blog unique when there are so many other style blogs out there but show what makes you different from others!" <em>&mdash; Caroline Yauck</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Pink or orange?</strong> Pink! I am crazy about both but prefer orange in smaller doses.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Stripes or plaid?</strong> Stripes for sure. Navy and white please!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Shimmery gold or matte white?</strong> I am a white enthusiast because it’s so clean and crisp.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Grapefruit or lemon?</strong> Such a hard choice ;) I love both – lemon juice is amazing in water and a sliced grapefruit with a sprinkle of sugar on top is the perfect snack.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What’s your favorite item in your wardrobe? Why?</strong> I would have to say my chambray shirt because of its versatility. I wear it constantly throughout every season and it can be dressed up or down. Every girl definitely needs one of these in her closet!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What’s one of the most exciting things that has happened to you since you launched Citrus &amp; Style?</strong> Although so many incredible things have come out of starting a blog, I would have to say the relationships I’ve developed are the most rewarding thing. Some of my best friends are people I’ve met through blogging and I can’t imagine my life without them!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Do you find that blogging on a frequent basis has improved your writing skills?</strong> Definitely. I’ve learned what my style of writing is and I truly think it has helped my English grade too!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Words of wisdom from you to another high-schooler: What’s one piece of essential advice you’d give a fellow student if they were about to launch their own style blog?</strong> My advice would be to stay true to yourself. It’s difficult to keep your blog unique when there are so many other style blogs out there but show what makes you different from others!

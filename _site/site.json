        "content"     : "<p><em>If you’re curious about what’s happening in the legal world of fashion, <strong>The Fashion Law</strong> by <strong>Julie Zerbo</strong> is the place to be. Julie started writing articles in law school as a way to learn more about fashion law - and just a short time later <strong>The Fashion Law</strong> was born. Today, TFL is frequented by both lawyers and non-lawyers who are looking for their daily-dose of fashionable legal commentary. We’re hooked, and if you’re not already - you should be, too. Meet <strong>Julie Zerbo</strong> of <strong>The Fashion Law</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We’re obsessed with The Fashion Law. Tell us about what made you want to launch TFL.</strong> Thank you. I only decided to launch the website as an afterthought. At the end of my first year of law school, one of my professors mentioned fashion law to me, and I was immediately intrigued by the marriage between the two fields, fashion and law. So, I started researching and writing on my own, exploring core legal concepts in the context of the fashion industry, as a way to learn about the topic. After a while, I had quite an archive of articles and decided to start sharing them in the form of a blog, because there really were not many sites at the time that were consistently providing content on fashion law and the business of fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging?</strong> It feels like a very long time ago. I launched the site in 2012.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a lawyer - a profession far different from almost anything in fashion as many of us know it. Did you study fashion as an undergrad before heading to law school? If not, how did you fall into fashion?</strong> I did not. My prior studies were in economics and international business. At that point in time, I was editing an economics journal and very much planning to pursue a career in that field. However, I took an internship with a law firm in my final semester of college (after taking a rudimentary business law course) and when it came time to graduate, my parents, who are both extremely smart, suggested law school, and I thought, “Sure, why not?” And so I went. My initial intention was to focus on constitutional law, though. I never pictured myself working in fashion.</p>\n\n<p>My interest in fashion is twofold, really. I have always had a significant appreciation for well-made, well-designed garments, and upon learning a bit about the core concepts of law, I was intrigued by the integral role that they play in the business of fashion. There is a lot more to fashion than meets the eye, and this is what drives me now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your main source of content inspiration? Do you frequent any websites, blogs, or publications to get information, or does press contact you directly?</strong> I frequent a lot of rather nerdy websites, such as Westlaw and Pacer (two big legal databases). I get most of my inspiration in terms of pending cases from these sites. As for the more general fashion-oriented articles on my site, overarching trends and issues in the industry often inspire me, such as why has London been such a hot bed for young talent over the past decade or what is the core objective of designer collaborations beyond the surface goal of selling the specific collection, these come from just being in the industry, I suppose, and being inquisitive beyond the most obvious trends, such as red for Fall/Winter 2015.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t really read other blogs too much because I get frustrated, as I tend to think everything should be academic or cerebral, or have substantial context, when that certainly is not the case. As for websites, I read Business of Fashion very regularly. I read absolutely everything that Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times writes. She is so sharp. Alexander Fury of The Independent is up there, as well. John Koblin, who writes for the New York Times, has also been on my radar lately. I also love that Cathy Horyn is back and writing for NY Magazine’s site! (I know I am forgetting someone here!)</p>\n\n<p>My one personal style blog exception is BryanBoy, who I admire because he doesn’t promote fast fashion and actually purchases a lot of his own clothing, which I think is refreshing and authentic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fashion law encompasses a variety of subjects, including copyright, trademark, and licensing (to name a few). What is your favorite thing to blog about/report on - and how do you typically get started? How long does an article take to complete - from start to finish?</strong> My favorite thing to write about is probably the trends in law or business in connection with the fashion industry. Much like the way fashion is representative of the time in which we are living, the trends in legal cases or ways of doing business are very much like this, as well. I also really enjoy writing about individuals in the industry who I admire. Raf Simons is a very good example of this.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t say that I have a set way of doing things. I am very lucky because I have the freedom to write about whatever I think is important at any given time and can approach the writing process in varying ways. Honestly, a lot of my writing begins on my iPhone in the car or during fashion month, for instance, I was doing a lot while I was waiting for shows to start. However, because there is a lot of research that goes into most of the posts, there is obviously a lot of time sitting in front of the computer, as well. As for time, some posts are very time-consuming, taking me an hour here, an hour there over a few days. Other posts, such as purely news ones, take 15 minutes at most.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Black. I almost always wear black and I’m not terribly girly. So, dark jeans and a Jil Sander tee or Prada knit tank top is usually it for me. I’m also very, very minimalist in terms of silhouettes and accessories. I hate jewelry (with the exception of a red bracelet that I never take off) and I hate the idea of dressing for attention. So, I suppose my personal style is best characterized as straightforward with an emphasis on the quality of my wardrobe. I have always preferred one really nice garment to five trendy, lower quality ones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us what you’re wearing to the courtroom (to defend your client, of course).</strong> In terms of work, I try to dress rather conservatively. I can’t stand skirt suits or the other stereotypical female lawyer staples, but a black blouse and trousers with a classic Manolo heel feels safe to me. That’s not to say I don’t wear cropped Haider pants or a Chalayan top from time to time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Prada or Gucci?</strong> Prada!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Forever21 or H&amp;M?</strong> Prada!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time? If not, how do you balance your full-time job with the demands of a heavily referenced resource blog?</strong> I do not. I have never actually blogged full time. I have always either been in school full time or working. I guess I have just chosen from early on to prioritize the website and as a result, I make time for it. So, you very rarely will see me at fashion parties! I’m at home writing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> Not that I can think of. From the beginning, the blogging process has been very trial and error and I have learned a lot this way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Do you have any general “rules of thumb” that you abide by when posting to social media?</strong> Social media is more of a secondary tool, a way for me to connect with readers and people who value the same things I do, such as high fashion (as opposed to fast fashion), education, and things like that. I don’t really have any rules of thumb. My social media presence isn’t terribly calculated like that and I think that’s what people generally respond to – that sense of authenticity. I did rather recently, however, launch my own personal Twitter to try to separate the personal from the TFL brand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on branded email marketing/campaigns - do you find that they help you build your brand’s viewership base?</strong> I don’t do anything like that. I don’t think I have ever really participated in things that actively seek to build a readership. I probably should, but that’s just not really what I’m about. I would much rather spend my time writing and researching, and I think it is important to just let my work speak for itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The relationships I’ve built. I met my mentor, Barbara Kolsun, as a result of my website. That has to be one of the single most rewarding results thus far. She has been practicing in this sector for so many years and is has such a wealth of valuable knowledge about law and the business of fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Also, being able to speak to an audience and share knowledge is pretty powerful, in my opinion. I gain a lot of joy from being able to emphasize the importance of education and intelligence to my peers and those that are even younger than me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you never expected to learn?</strong> It has taught (and continues to teach) me to be true to my vision, and to be objective at all costs, which is much more difficult than it sounds!</p>\n"

She blogs to provide creative dressing inspiration for her readers, while giving them a sneak peek into her life. We love the glitter and gold scattered about <strong>The Black Barcode</strong> and adore Madeline’s passion for her work. Meet <strong>Madeline</strong> of <strong>The Black Barcode</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about The Black Barcode.</strong> The Black Barcode is a place to come if you need help picking an outfit out for the next day. It’s to help inspire others to want to get dressed and be creative with what they are wearing. Not only will you find fashion inspiration but also to see the places I’ve been and food I’ve had and things I’ve purchased. It’s an inside look into my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you choose the name and color scheme for your blog?</strong> The name for my blog came from a project I did in 11th grade photograph. It was just showing how everyone dresses the way they are told from media, and not having a personal style. Everyone in my school wore leggings, Uggs and Northface jackets; they wore the same thing everyday. So the name “The Black Barcode” is basically a spin from that, barcodes all look the same, and I wanted my blog to show you that you don’t have to fit in with what you are told. I choose the color scheme for my blog because you can never go wrong with a little gold and glitter!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> I find inspiration from other bloggers. I follow a ton of bloggers and check their sites everyday to get inspiration on what is on trend, or ways to style different things. I feel like if they can do it, I can do it, so it inspires me to keep going!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My personal style is pretty classic; I wear a lot of red white and blue, and try to be as put together as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Heels or flats?</strong> Flats for now! I’m in school and it’s just much easier to go class to class in my favorite Tory Burch Reva flats!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Gelato or ice cream?</strong> Ice Cream! I love making my own at home by adding in caramel sauce or mini M&amp;M’s!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take more cues from street style or runway fashion?</strong> I get more from runway fashion because I can take what’s on the runway and make outfits from current pieces I already own for a much affordable price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start to finish, including “thinking”, photography, editing, and content writing)</strong> It usually depends on what I’m doing, sometimes I can figure out what I want to post quickly, but others take time, I post every other day so I’ll give myself that time to do everything!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Well it would have to include a J.Crew excursion vest, because I own about 6 of them. I would wear a classic outfit, my Steve Madden riding boots, probably my J.Crew herringbone vest, a soft black long sleeve shirt with dark wash jeans. For jewelry my monogram necklace, gold watch and Kate Spade bow ring!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has social media done for your blog? What platform has had the biggest impact on your audience growth?</strong> I’m currently only on Instagram (@monobelleprep) and Pinterest (theblackbarcode) and Twitter (@theblackbarcode). I started off on Instagram before ever starting a blog, so Instagram probably has helped connect my follows to my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?</strong> Really anyone that is around that day, so usually my best friend, boyfriend, or sister! I have a Canon T3I and absolutely love it! I wish I were able to take my own photos since I love photography just as much!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> Becoming friends with a lot of other fashion bloggers, and making great connections with people I wouldn’t have without my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> Take photos in different locations. I can still do that, but I wish I had used a variety of different locations in my earlier posts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> To be organized, and how to plan. It takes a lot of time to come up with the finish product, so being organized can save you a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be yourself and use original content.</p>\n"

Now, she continues to blog and post part-time (she’s still in school) about everything from personal style to do-it-yourself tutorials. She confesses that the key to taking an amazing photo is “just to practice”, admits she’d opt for pink/rose gold over yellow gold any day, and stresses how important a media kit is for any blog. Meet <strong>Michelle</strong> of <strong>UF Fashion Files</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long ago did you start UF Fashion Files?</strong> I started UF Fashion Files in fall 2012 as a class assignment, but later fell in love with blogging and continued to post for the next 3 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started your blog, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong> Originally, I wanted to feature only University of Florida students and their fashionable outfits. But, when my course load piled up and my free time on campus vanished, I started to tweak my site to have more fashion tips as well as outfit ideas. During the summer months, I photographed looks I wore back home and featured them on my blog. Now, my blog is more personal with outfit ideas, inspiration posts and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time, or is it just a hobby right now?</strong> Blogging is definitely a hobby for me, since I’m still in school right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We all know the saying: a photo speaks a thousand words. What’s the key to taking a good photo?</strong> When I take photos, or have photos taken, I always make sure there’s a ton of options. I’ve learned over time what are the most flattering angles and how to operate my DSLR to get high-quality images. The key is just to practice!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> I love blogging. It can get tough at times when I feel overwhelmed with school and my internship. But, when I have free time, I love putting up a new post and connecting with my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> I would say that my style is classic and comfortable. I grew up in California, so I definitely embodied that Southern California laid-back style when it comes to getting dressed. I always reach for comfy soft shirts and flowy dresses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong> In five years, I see myself working at a fashion or women’s magazine as a contributing writer. I would also hope to freelance for other publications on the side, as well as still write for my blog!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Pink gold or yellow gold?</strong> Pink gold! I have two rose gold diamond rings and a rose gold dainty heart necklace that I wear every day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> That’s a hard choice. My outfit changes on my mood, as cliche as that sounds! But my go-to look is always a chambray shirt with jeans and ballet flats. You can’t ever go wrong and you’re always comfortable! I love fun accessories, so with a look like this, I’ll wear bright shoes or a cool bag and my favorite pair of sunglasses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has social media done for your blog? What platform has had the biggest impact on your audience growth?</strong> Social media is one of my favorite parts of blogging. I love Instagram; it’s always awesome getting inspiration from designers and other bloggers, as well as meeting other college fashion bloggers. It’s such a great way to not only spread your blog’s influence, but make new friends, too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> How important a media kit can be. I made one for my site over the summer and I didn’t realize how fun it would be to put together! It has helped a lot with collaborations and building business connections. I love working with design so I’m hoping one day I can redesign my blog myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> There are a few minor things I would have tweaked but for the most part, I love my blog. It’s definitely been a learning experience, but a fun one! I never blog when I can’t put my 110% of effort into it because I want my readers to really enjoy what I post. The one thing I would change would be my name, since I am graduating in May. But, that’s easily changeable and I may already have something coming up in the future (wink, wink).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> I don’t know who said it but I love the quote “Don’t be like the rest of them, darling.” I painted it on a canvas for my freshman year of college as a little daily reminder to stay true to myself. It’s still one of my favorites!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Just have fun. So many more people are blogging now, so it’s important to just be unique and continue to post as long as you’re enjoying it. Blogs are supposed to be fun not only for your readers, but for you, as well. So don’t be afraid to try something new and write about it; you’re making memories that you’ll never forget.</p>\n"

Originally from Tennessee but currently residing in Washington, D.C., Kristyn blogs about fashion, style, and more, collaborating with awesome brands like H&amp;M; and Julep. The bubbly blonde gave us a sneak peek into her blogging world. Meet <strong>Kristyn</strong> with Blogspotter today!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for Primp &amp; Proper and what made you start?</strong> I’ve been blogging for 13+ months now. I originally started blogging back in January 2014 as a way to document my adventures in DC… a.k.a. provide an outlet for my family to keep up with what I’ve been doing, ha! After I got more and more into the blogging scene of DC, I decided to commit fully and grow my blog way beyond an online journal of my time in DC.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love all the gold and glitter in your branding. How did you decide on a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?</strong> Thanks! When it came to the design and layout, I wanted to keep it simple and clean. I didn’t want just a black and white theme, so I added a pop of glitter and gold to make the design more fun. I worked with a great designer, Tammy of A Loyal Love, and together we created my site. As for the name, Primp &amp; Proper is a play on a Southern saying, prim and proper. I thought the name fit me and what I was blogging about very well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you balance a full-time job and part-time blogging? Any rules of time management that you live by?</strong> Well it definitely isn’t easy, ha! I pretty much consider blogging a second full-time job. I spend about 17+ hours a week on blogging and everything that goes into it. For me, it’s all about managing your time and doing what’s necessary first. Instead of trying to do 10 things at once, I categorize my to-do list in order of importance. That way I never miss a deadline. I also use the Day Designer planner, which I highly recommend, that helps me keep track of my day-to-day and daily tasks. I also color code the important tasks and highlight items once they’re finished. I’m OCD about leaving items unchecked or not highlighted, so it helps motivate me to finish what’s on my list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without? It really depends on the season.</strong> For now, it’s definitely my H&amp;M tote. I own it in three colors… yes, three. I love it. Molly Sims even complimented me on it and couldn’t believe it wasn’t a designer handbag. I can’t recommend this tote enough. It’s perfect for work or daily use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have a favorite blog?</strong> It’s so hard to choose just one, but I would say some of the blogs I read daily are Waiting on Martha, Glitter Guide (online magazine), Fashionable Hostess, What Courtney Wore and Sequins &amp; Stripes. I also follow a lot of DC blogs (some of them are even very good friends)! Too many to name, but love them all!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fashion Week is live and happening! Are you super excited about any designers in particular?</strong> I will admit that this year was the first year I actually sat down and watched some of the shows live. Every year I have to rely on recaps and reviews, simply because Fashion Week is always during busy season at work. This year I watched Tadashi Shoji, Rebecca Minkoff and a few others. I actually did a recap of some of my fave shows here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK: Red matte lips or nude shiny gloss?</strong> Easy. Nude shiny gloss. I’m all about the subtle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your must-have items?</strong> A good tote bag for work, a great pair of heels for work and boots for every day use, a nude gloss and my hot rollers (these are the exact ones I use).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What camera do you use?</strong> Any tips for taking that perfect photo? I use a Canon SLR. Definitely pay attention to your white balance and ISO (thanks Julien for the tips!!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long does it typically take to complete a blog post?</strong> It usually depends on the type of post. One of my more simple posts, like Thursday’s 10 Thoughts, takes about an hour from beginning to end. That includes creating the post, editing photos, proofreading, and then scheduling social media posts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A more in depth post, like an outfit of the day or recipe, can take anywhere from 3-4 hours total.</strong> That includes taking the outfit photos or cooking the recipe. I usually have one of these types of posts max each week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has social media impacted your blog’s audience?</strong> Social media is HUGE! It’s super important to share your post and interact with your followers/readers. That only helps to grow your social media following, and ultimately your blog readership.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK: Facebook or Instagram?</strong> Instagram… definitely, Instagram.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> That’s a tough one, because I’ve learned SO many things over the past year. I’m still learning new things each and every day. I guess one “surprise” that has come from blogging that I never expected, was how many real life friends I would make through it. Blogging is about sharing your life on the web. I never thought those friends I connected with via Twitter or Facebook, would turn out to be good friends I hang out with all the time. It has been a very nice surprise!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your sister was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of advice you would give her?</strong> Oh gosh… I feel like I could talk about this question for hours. Simply because I knew nothing when I started my blog. Knew absolutely nothing. I’ve written a few posts about this and have a few more on the way, but my number one piece of advice is to educate yourself on what all goes into having a blog and on protecting yourself. Your blog is a business, so it’s vital you know what all comes along with that.</p>\n"

I started blogging at a very young age, as I got older my love for fashion grew with me. It wasn’t until I was at my first year of college that I decided to do personal style and outfit’s posts. I was a very insecure girl and the blog somehow helped me to be more confident and embrace who I was.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I’ve being blogging for four years. I started my blog in 2011, when I was sixteen years old.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you know it was the right time to launch your blog?</strong> I didn’t. I knew I wanted to have my little corner of inspiration on the web, but I wasn’t sure when was the right time. One thing I’m sure, what motivated me from the beginning to make a blog was the opportunity to share my inspirations and passions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> I find lots of inspiration in magazines and of course, Instagram.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My personal style is very eclectic, feminine and diverse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite brand?</strong> I have a few favorite brands, but a girl must love Chanel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Chocolate chip cookies or sugar cookies?</strong> Chocolate chip cookies. No doubt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start to finish, including “thinking”, photography, editing, and content writing)</strong> It depends, sometimes I schedule certain days to take the photos other times is spontaneous; but, I always make sure the location is the appropriated for the outfit. Outfits photos take from 30 minutes to a 1-hour depending on the climate, lighting, the place, etc. What really consumes my time is choosing the pictures, editing them, putting together the full post with links and written material. That takes me a 1-hour or more. It all depends on the type of post I’m writing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has social media helped the growth of your blog?</strong> Social media has helped me expand my blog readers. I reach more people through my posts and it helps me engage more with my followers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that blogging has been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> Definitely, being a blogger has opened many doors for me, opportunities that I never imagined possible. I feel very lucky that my blog, which started as a hobby is now my job. I wouldn’t change it for anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?</strong> Most of the time, my Mom takes my pictures, she has become quite the expert, and my closes friends help me too. I use my Cannon Rebel 5ti with a 75-300mm lens, depending on the photo, we change the lenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> I’ve learned that building a successful blog takes time and dedication. You really need to engage and be passionate about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Rounded toe or pointed toe heels?</strong> For sure, pointed toe heels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I wouldn’t change anything; I have learned and grow so much from this experience and I’m very grateful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> If you have a passion for something, go for it. Be always yourself and enjoy it.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>BreAnne Elenburg</strong> is the Texan beauty behind <strong>BEING/BE</strong>. She’s rather new to the blogging world (she officially started blogging August 2014) but she’s getting the hang of it rather quickly: she’s already amassed loyal a following and learned a thing or two. Meet <strong>BreAnne</strong> of <strong>BEING/BE</strong> with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about BEING/BE.</strong> I started my blog to showcase my passion for fashion. The greatest way I know to express myself is through fashion and the more I learn about the industry the more I evolve; my personality, my mood, and sometimes a coffee and/or wine spill is evident through my outfit. After countless hours of following amazing fashion bloggers I decided to start my own to share my creativity in hopes that people will see that style, just like the little ole word “be”, is limitless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We’re so curious: how did you come up with the name “BEING/BE”?</strong> If you were to look up the word “be” in the dictionary, the definition would bore you with the simplicity and vagueness of it. But then again how do you sum up the magnitude of the word? In my opinion, BE is to exist, it’s to take place, to happen or occur, it means to continue or remain as before; BE is whatever you want it to be. That is where the name of the blog came from. I live by a mantra of always being who you are. Well, I’m Being/BE-BreAnne Elenburg.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging?</strong> End of August 2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about style and beauty. What’s your favorite thing to blog about?</strong> Definitely style; beauty is a blast, don’t get me wrong, but fashion is always changing and I love the opportunity my followers give me to keep them up to date with the latest trends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you formally study fashion as an undergrad? If not, do you find that you’re able to incorporate what you did study into your blog?</strong> Yes! I was extremely fortunate to study Fashion Merchandising at Texas Christian University.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Hot pink or bright yellow?</strong> Hot pink all the way!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite brand?</strong> Oh wow, this a toughie! It’s hard to say what my favorite brand is because they all have unique qualities about them that I like to add to my wardrobe. BUT- I will say you can normally find me in at least one item from J.Crew or Madewell. However, if we are talking designers, I would definitely have to say YSL!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> As I mentioned a bit in why I started my blog, defining my personal style would be impossible. I dress how I feel that particular day and this can range from an all-black ensemble for a simple trip to the grocery store to ripped jeans with a flannel and converse for a night out with my girls. You just simply never know!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite guilty pleasure food?</strong> Popcorn! I could eat popcorn for every meal! Add extra butter and nacho cheese seasoning salt and you have heaven in a bucket!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite outfit in your wardrobe? What is it?</strong> My go-to outfit when I’m having just “one of those days” is my most comfortable pair of jeans, a simple top and some type of jacket (usually I go with leather to spice up my life a bit). This outfit is then paired with either flats or pumps, but don’t even try to ask what my favorite pair of shoes is because that is an impossible question!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk Texas! What’s your favorite thing about Texas, and the south?</strong>\nI love the southern hospitality of living in Texas. Everyone is friendly and I love meeting someone only to feel like I’ve known them my whole life after just five minutes of talking! I also can’t go without mentioning teased hair. Big hair is such a Texas thing and I’m obsessed with it! The bigger the hair the closer to Heaven!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> There are a number of successful bloggers that I keep up with on a daily basis. These women are incredibly inspirational to me and I love how each blog is unique in its own way. I also try to stay on top of major retailers and designers to see up and coming trends. And of course, Pinterest; what girl doesn’t love Pinterest?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you?</strong> Amanda Marie Lackey is my amazing photographer!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Creating a blog has definitely had its ups and downs. It’s not as easy as it looks! Developing your own unique way that is consistent requires you to look into yourself and figure out the way you want to be perceived. I’ve learned that patience is key and I won’t have a billion dedicated followers overnight, as well. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had because it has taught me to be comfortable in my own skin. There is no right or wrong way to be a blogger except to just be myself and enjoy what I do!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The ability to express myself is definitely the most rewarding component of blogging. There is a much deeper level of satisfaction when you can share your passion with the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be YOU! You can try your best to mimic other bloggers but at the end of the day you want to be yourself.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Whitney Damrau</strong> and <strong>Blaire Bingham</strong> are the brains behind <strong>Peaches In A Pod</strong>, a Georgia-based fashion and style blog. They love peach cobbler (yum!), are close family friends (they’ve known each other for over 15 years), and are very thankful for what Instagram has done for their blog and their following. Meet Whitney and Blaire of Peaches In A Pod with Blogspotter today!</em></p>\n\n<p>**How did you meet? **\nWhitney grew up with Blaire’s husband and both families have been friends for many years. When Blaire started dating her husband we were always together.<br />\nIt’s crazy that we have known each other for more than 15 years!</p>\n\n<p>**How long ago did you start Peaches In A Pod? **\nPeaches In A Pod was started in January of 2014, so we are wee babes in the blog world.</p>\n\n<p>**The name (Peaches In A Pod) is so cute! How did you come up with it? **\nWe have always shared a similar style, and we are always talking fashion, so we are definitely two peas in a pod in that aspect.  We also knew that we wanted to incorporate the fact that we are from Georgia, so put those two together, and Peaches In A Pod was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started Peaches In A Pod, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong>\nWe have always inspired each other when it comes to fashion, so we started this blog as a way to inspire other women, like us. We have definitely stuck to that ideal, and we hope to continue to inspire with our own fashion experiments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photos are so beautiful! Who takes your photos for you?</strong>\nWell thank you! We take our own pictures. We make it really fun by leaving the kids and husbands at home and go on outfit shoots. We change in the car in remote locations. Changing into skinny jeans behind a steering wheel gets us into fits of hysterics, and by the end there are hangers, shoes and accessories everywhere!</p>\n\n<p>**How does living in Georgia influence your style? **\nThe weather in Georgia is constantly changing. It could be in the 40’s in the morning and above 70 by the afternoon, so we incorporate a lot of layers into our style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you balance family/work/life with blogging?</strong>\nWe are still working on that! Thank goodness there are two of us!\n<strong>B:</strong> I work during the day when my kids are at school.\n<strong>W:</strong> I stay at home with my 2 year old and work from home, so juggling that plus the blog has it challenges. It’s amazing how much I can accomplish during nap time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have a favorite blog? **\n**B:</strong> My blog inspiration is Sequins and Things. I just love her style!  **W: **I’m loving Southern Curls and Pearls. Caitlin is fabulous and her style is so well put together!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself (with Peaches In A Pod) in a year?</strong>\nThat’s a great question! We are planning on making the blog bigger and better by improving the site itself. We want to improve speed and functionality. Hopefully switching blog platforms will allow us to do that.</p>\n\n<p>**QUICK: Peach cobbler or peach lemonade? **\n**B: **Cobbler definitely!\n**W: **OMG both are in my top 5 favorite things! Cobbler!</p>\n\n<p>**If you could only wear one outfit every day for the rest of your life, what would it be? **\n**B: **Skinny jeans with a great jacket and statement booties.\n**W: **A fit and flare dress, cropped jacket and booties or wedges depending on the season. I am totally a dress girl!</p>\n\n<p>**What camera do you use? **\nCanon DSLR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long, from start to finish, does it take to complete a blog post? **\n**From idea to publication, it takes about a week.  We have several drafts in the works at all times.</strong></p>\n\n<p>**How has social media impacted your blog’s audience? Do you have a favorite platform? **Social media has helped us grow our audience tremendously!  Instagram is probably our favorite, but we also love interacting with brands on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong>\nWe didn’t expect to make the friendships that we have made. We love getting to meet and interact with other bloggers. You would think as a blogger, that you sit in an office all day on a computer, but we are constantly in contact with other bloggers, and it has really been refreshing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong>\nWhen we started this blog, we had no idea what we were doing, or if we would have any readers. We are so grateful for each and every viewer, and we are blessed to get to do what we love.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?</strong>\nBuilding a blog community has been the most helpful in getting our blog going.  Joining surrounding blog societies and reaching out to other bloggers has not only built up an audience, but also made this process a lot of fun.</p>\n"

Get to know Erin of Miss Erin Says with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your blog! Tell us a little bit about it.</strong> My blog is a creative outlet for everything I have to say in a visual and text based format. I highlight fashion and sprinkle in a few savvy beauty tips and a dash of sassy lifestyle events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging, and what was it that made you want to start?</strong> I officially started blogging in November of 2013 like many, current, and future bloggers I had always wanted to start a blog. What inspired me to pursue blogging was the realization that I had become a blogger without a blog! I had been dabbling in guest posting for other blogs and finally the light went off that I could actually do this. I then created Miss Erin Says as a creative space to share my passions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about fashion, beauty, and lifestyle - what’s your favorite thing to blog about, and why?</strong> My favorite thing to blog about would be fashion and my personal style. When I started my blog I didn’t want to limit myself so I incorporated multiple categories. Over time my favorite highlights have been fashion focused. I think this is due to my true appreciation for clothing as most of my life I didn’t fit into “traditional” sizes. After a weight loss journey I now am on a fashion journey and I love sharing and inspiring others along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> My blogging inspiration is found within other like-minded women. Diane Von Furstenberg’s quote sums it up best. “The success of every single woman is an inspiration for another.” — D.V.F</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would describe my personal style as classic and feminine with a twist. I love structured garments and classic iconic shapes. Statement pieces with unique details are what draw me. I believe in wardrobe focal points often found in the form of a great handbag! My go to wardrobe piece is a dramatic skirt thus the twist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Polka dots or stripes?</strong> STRIPES!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Lipstick or lipgloss?</strong> Matte Lipstick</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> Blogging has been a journey and a getaway into a world that I love. I would say that it has definitely been a worthwhile endeavor. As I have met so many inspirational people. I have learned a ton about myself thus far and learned to challenge myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?</strong> My best friend turned photographer William (a.k.a. Billy) takes my photos. We currently shoot with a Nikon D5300 but we started with an iPhone5 and well now we are here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your take on social media? How has social media generally helped with the branding of your blog?</strong> My take on social media is that is is an amazingly powerful tool that is ever evolving and changing. In terms of branding social media has been a great tool to assist my brand in reaching new audience worldwide.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> That would have to be having the honor of meeting Tory Burch. She was a joy and is one of the most humble, genuine and talented individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you so far?</strong> Maintaining a blog has taught me about flexibility. I naturally have a type “A” personality so this has been a challenge for me but I am now learning the fine art of flexibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you?</strong> Blogging has taught me to step outside comfort zone in multiple arenas including social scenarios and within my personal style</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend decided to launch her own blog, what piece of advice would you give her?</strong> My advice would be to define three things your voice, who you want to inspire, and why you want to blog. Once you have defined these three aspects REMEMBER them and utilize them throughout your journey as your guides. Then make a plan A and after you have devised plan A be ready for that plan to change. Because, after all, there are 26 letters in the alphabet.</p>\n"

Meet Ms. Fujita with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about  your blog, Couture Crush.</strong> My blog is a personal style blog that combines trends and influences from both western and asian culture. My main focus is fashion but I also do beauty trends, DIYs, and travel posts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging?</strong> I officially started blogging the Summer of 2013</p>\n\n<p><strong>We’re so jealous you live in Hawaii! How does living in Hawaii influence your style?</strong> Living in Hawaii, the fashion community here is small, with the style being very casual and laid back, making it hard for me to dress up often. I always have a much more simple style while in Hawaii compared to when I’m back in Japan. It’s really cool to see the contrast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you formally study fashion as an undergrad? If not, do you find that you’re able to incorporate what you did study into your blog?</strong> I’m still in high school, so no I have not had any study experience in regards to fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I’m obsessed with Blair Waldorf’s style from Gossip Girl. She has been my biggest style inspiration. Her and Japanese fashion magazines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> A mix of preppy, feminine, and classic style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Bikini or monokini?</strong> Bikini ! I’ve never tried a monokini… yet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory? What is it?</strong> Handbags are my favorite accessory. I feel like you’re set for anything if you invest in one good handbag. It’s something you will use everyday and if you get a classic style, it’s timeless so you don’t have to worry about switching up handbags. It’ll always be in style!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about a favorite beauty product?</strong> Right now my favorite beauty product is Benefit’s They’re Real Push up liner! It makes it so so easy to make a perfect cat eye or clean line! Who ever invented it is a genius.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You mention that you’re inspired by Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Blair Waldorf. What is it about each of those style icon that you love the most?</strong> I love Audrey Hepburn’s elegance. It’s amazing, she just has this natural beauty and glamour. I love that Grace Kelly’s style focuses on simplicity making it timeless and recreatable. She always looks so pulled together. Blair Waldorf is just amazing at pulling off outfits. She combines so many elements, patterns, and colors, some outfits you know you wouldn’t have thought about combining, but somehow she pulls it off.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> IFB for sure! There’s so many articles that cover a large range of topics regarding tips on blogging, marketing, ideas, etc. If there’s a question about fashion blogging you will for sure find the answer on IFB.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?</strong> I switch back and forth between taking pictures on my own and having my best friend take it.  I use the Leica M Series camera but when I take the pictures myself (using a stand) I use my Casio TR-350</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> Social media for sure plays a large part ! It really helps in driving traffic to my blog. I mainly use Lookbook and Chictopia as well as Facebook, Bloglovin, and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The most rewarding component is how much fun I have. It takes a lot of time and work but it’s fun to put a lot of effort into doing something you love. It’s a whole process from taking the pictures, thinking of the content, the editing, and then the satisfaction of finally publishing the post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has blogging taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> Blogging taught me a lot about patience. You can’t just suddenly start a blog and expect things to go well or followers to increase in a short amount of time. You have to gradually keep working at it and making improvements everyday. At first I was really frustrated when pictures didn’t turn out right, or I couldn’t make the right words for what I wanted to say or if my visitor counts were down that month!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> Reach out to other bloggers and use as many resources as you can! Try to collect as many perspective as you can to figure out what direction you want to take your blog. It’s hard to start blogging when you’re not sure what you’re doing, so I find it best to gradually figure out what’s you and what you like so you can have a clear focus on working towards that goal.</p>\n"

Get to know the brunette beauty today with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about A Trendy Peace</strong> A Trendy Peace is a place where I can share two of my favorite things – shopping and styling looks. It’s been a great platform to further my extreme shopaholic tendencies. My goal is to put together looks that are a mix of high end and budget friendly pieces and it’s a fun place to explore different trends and styles that I don’t always get to wear around work and everyday life. A Trendy Peace is my creative outlet and it’s an added bonus that so many wonderful people follow along and support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging?</strong> ATP kicked off officially in July 2014.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does living in Boston, MA influence your style?</strong> It can be tricky trying to find looks that are weather appropriate during the cooler seasons, like now for example when it’s consistently less than zero degrees and there is about seven feet of snow on the ground. Every morning I wonder if it’s worth risking frostbite or a broken ankle to wear a great pair of heels. Boston is such a fun city with so many different styles, it’s fun to people watch for style inspiration. Boston’s business scene definitely shows up in my style a lot where I mix boardroom friendly pieces with casual or girly pieces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you formally study fashion as an undergrad? If not, do you find that you’re able to incorporate what you did study into your blog?</strong> I’ve never formally studied fashion; my education background is in finance and business. If you’re looking to collaborate with brands or grow a large following, running a blog is a lot like running a business so I do find myself applying some of what I’ve learned to the blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Other bloggers! I’ve been following some of my favorite blogs for years and whether my style shows a subtle influence or is outright duplicating a look, I am always trying to catch up all of my favorites’ new posts. Oh yeah, and Vogue helps too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> It definitely varies a lot, I think the principles to my style are to find trends and pieces that really work for my body and the philosophy of investment pieces. You’ll see I often wear oversize tops with skinnier bottoms because I love how I feel in that style – and with the addition of a gorgeous designer handbag, that budget friendly T.J. Maxx outfit takes you from looking like a million bucks – to ten million.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Latte or cappuccino?</strong> Latte! Although honestly, usually it’s just an espresso, please!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Navy or black?</strong> All black everythang – it’s a classic look that can never go out of style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory? What is it?</strong> A good handbag. My Louis Vuitton speedy will probably forever be my favorite accessory because it was the first investment piece I ever bought – I bought it after college and a few months at my big girl job to celebrate officially being a grownup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> I schedule my posts once a week using Blogger, Hootsuite, and the tools available on Facebook. I work with <a href=\"http://www.tisket.com/\">Tisket</a> to create the shoppable carousels in each of my blog posts. And I use Lightroom for editing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?</strong> When I’m lucky, Jill from <a href=\"http://maggiejillphotography.weebly.com/\">Maggie Jill Photography</a> takes my photos – she was the first person to help me get the blog started. She shoots with a Nikon D610. When she’s busy being fabulous and running her own business, my wonderful manfriend takes my photos using a Nikon D3100.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial to your success?</strong> Absolutely. I don’t think a soul would know about the blog if it weren’t for Instagram. I think IG is the most important for me, followed by Bloglovin and Facebook. I think it’s important to give people access to your blog on any channel, so they can follow along with you the way they want to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> Being able to share something I love and am passionate about with so many wonderful, sweet, people. The amount of support in the blogging community is amazing – everyone is so supportive and only has nice things to say. Finding new bloggers gives me new sources of style inspiration and it’s wonderful to connect with ladies all over the world who have as big a shopping habit as I do!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has blogging taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> That it makes you feel really great to wear a fabulous outfit everyday, that there are SO many more places to shop than I thought, and that taking great selfies is SO much harder than it looks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to give one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be?</strong> Share the love. Don’t be afraid to tell other bloggers (or anyone for that matter) that you love their look. Getting a compliment on a look I’ve styled makes my day and it’s a great way to start connecting with other bloggers and get your blog out there!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>If you’re as obsessed with rising bloggers as we are, <strong>Nohealani Cutting</strong> of <strong>Style By Nohea</strong> should definitely be on your radar.

Her name (appropriately) means “beautiful heavenly gift” in Hawaiian, she recognizes the importance of social media (and the influence it’s had on her success), and above all, she loves and cherishes her close friends. Meet the beauty behind <strong>Style By Nohea</strong> with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your blog! Tell us a little bit about Style By Nohea.</strong> It started as a blog just about my personal style and fashion advice, but has turned into a blog about everything I love - fashion, beauty, travel, home, cooking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your name is beautiful! What does it mean?</strong> Thanks! It means ‘beautiful heavenly gift’ in Hawaiian.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you officially start blogging, and what was it that made you want to start?</strong> I started my blog in late 2011 because everyone always asks me for fashion advice, so I decided to share my advice with the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about fashion, beauty, and lifestyle - what’s your favorite thing to blog about, and why?</strong> This is tough, but fashion. I get a LOT of commentary from people saying that I’ve inspired them in the fashion realm because I’m not stick thin. These comments mean SO much to me and really keep me going knowing that there are people out there that are inspired by me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you frequent any websites for daily inspiration? What are they?</strong> I definitely frequent Instagram 24/7 for inspiration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what type of camera do you use?</strong> I have my artsy friends take my photos because they understand me and my blog the most… I’ve tried different photographers, but they can’t seem to capture what I want and my friends seem to do it the best! I usually repay them with a treat to happy hour… I really do have the best friends. I have a Canon Rebel and I’m experimenting with different lenses… right now I have a 50mm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?</strong> Yes, I’ve always been interested in fashion! I used to want to be a designer but then I took a sewing class and quickly found out that I sucked at sewing. But I am a graphic designer and digital marketer and hope to carry out my talents in the fashion industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Feminine with an edgy and grungy twist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Polka dots or stripes?</strong> Stripes, duh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> Social media is 100% crucial for blogging. Without it, I know that my blog would not have reached the level it’s at today. The social media platform definitely depends on the type of blog. For fashion or travel it would be Instagram, beauty would be YouTube, and lifestyle would be really any social platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Probably being able to work with huge brands like Piperlime, ShopBop, SexyHair, Neutrogena, and a lot more. I was also just brought on as a contributor to AOL’s StyleList! These types of things really keep me going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Gold accents or silver accents?</strong> All gold errthang.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you?</strong> To not be afraid of what people think about me. I have some people laughing at me and some people telling me that I’ve inspired them to start their own blogs and businesses or simply made them feel good about themselves. The people that enjoy my blog are the reason why I do it… imagine what kind of inspiration I would be if I quit because of the people that laugh at me?</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend decided to launch her own blog, what piece of advice would you give her?</strong> To not aim for perfection. Blogging is a learning process. You will not know everything when you first start, and no one expects you to. Just learn as you go and don’t freak out if things aren’t perfect or if things aren’t going the way you planned.</p>\n"

Her little corner of the web is filled with inspiring images, from her beyond chic daily looks to Alexander McQueen runway footage. A self-described “odd duck”, Lauren likes to do what others don’t, and her blog shines with originality. Read more about Lauren and her learning process with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I started truly blogging on my instagram account about a year ago, and my Tumblr followed suit soon after.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start Lauren Christine?</strong> I have always had this extreme love for all things fashion and style. I’ve worked with Urban Outfitters for years now and I think working there really sparked my love for clothing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to blog on Tumblr?</strong> I love Tumblr. I think the set up is clean and effervescent. You can make your page look however you want it to, and it all just flows. Instagram is where my heart is though. I love creating an Instagram account that’s aesthetically pleasing. Everything has to make sense in the big picture, I think that’s easier accomplished with Tumblr, but I try very hard to accomplish that with my Instagram as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started your blog, what did you have in mind?</strong> I wanted a page that inspired people to think differently. Something that made people question how they thought and felt about fashion. Alexander McQueen is my idol. And his clothing is art. It shocks people and makes them really think. I just love that about clothing, it’s truly art.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has it stayed true to that original idea? How has it evolved?</strong> I think it has definitely stayed true to original idea I was going for. I post a lot of trendy things, but I try to stick mostly to fashion related things. I can’t help posting a beautiful scenery shot here and there though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to share your inspirations?</strong> I think that its important for people to get a chance to express themselves how they choose. Everyone is expressing something through their style of dress, and I wanted to share how I like to dress hoping that it sparks some interest in other peoples’ self expression.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your own style?</strong> Oh my goodness, where to start. I don’t really have one honestly. I say bohemian a lot because I love oversized clothing, but I change my mind too often to really have a sense of only one style. I go with what I’m feeling that day, super girly and chic, or rocker chick and laid back. It really changes from day to day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Two words. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN. He was such a brilliant man, and constantly pushed the envelope. I absolutely love and worship his clothing. If I could, I would but every piece from his Plato’s Atlantis collection and have it kept neatly in a glass box just so I could admire it daily. His clothing is created for women who don’t care about society’s view of fashion. It’s made for women who dress the way they choose to because THEY CHOSE TO, not because it’s trendy. I love him for that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take more cues from street style or runway fashion?</strong> Street style, always and forever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you go about choosing post-worthy outfits and makeup looks?</strong> I don’t sit and contemplate that much, when I see what I like I instantly post it, that’s just how I’ve always been. I know what I like and what I don’t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> I have been given some fun opportunities throughout my blogging career. I’ve gotten some chances to work with up and coming clothing companies, swimwear companies and up and coming blogs. I think the best opportunity that I’ve been given is the gift of friendship. It’s crazy the people you meet through blogging, everyone I’ve come across have been a joy to work with and I’m lucky for that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> Not a thing. It’s a learning process. I used to really care how people would react to my blog and my photos and now I try to focus more on being true to myself. I post and say what I want to, in hopes people will like it but if they don’t, I don’t sweat it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> To be organized. I have always been organized but when blogging it really comes into play. You must know when you should post, what you should post, how many photos to post at once and all that fun jazz. Organization is key to good blogging!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey through Lauren Christine?</strong> To be yourself! I have always been kind of an odd duck, I like to do what others don’t and I like to be an individual. I think it’s important for people to know that being different isn’t bad, and I think that’s the main thing I want to convey. Just be you, always no matter what.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be honest with yourself. Do things, post things and write about things that truly inspire you and bring happiness to your life, I find that it transcends and your followers will feel that.</p>\n"

Get a dose of inspiration and sunshine via Pink Champagne. Learn more about Michelle and her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I began blogging in 2010 as a creative spot to plan my wedding and share all of my favorite things. Fashion was always a focus, but it has certainly evolved a great deal over four years (time flies!) from the days of sharing centerpieces and gushing over bridal gowns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Champagne is my drink of choice, even better when pink (my favorite color)! Life is better when decked out in pink and toasting with a glass of bubbly, no? Chin chin!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My style is classic and feminine, with a fun, glamorous twist! I adore bright colors, bows, and glitter. In two words: Kate Spade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Pink Bubbly, of course! The collection is curated solely by myself, so surely I am obsessed with everything from sparkly studs to statement necklaces to monogrammed pieces and beyond. Kate Spade, Lilly Pulitzer, and J.Crew also make me weak in the knees… so much pretty in one place!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Is this a trick question? Pink! Whether on my lips, my feet, or an article of clothing, pink is my first choice. I am also loving aqua at the moment, and navy is a classic that I will never tire of. As far as prints, I love polka dots and stripes, but my heart will always belong to Lilly prints (all of them).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you more inspired by street style or runway fashion, or does your inspiration come from somewhere altogether different?</strong> Is it cheating to say both? Come fashion week, I am glued to my laptop streaming the shows to get a glimpse of fashions to come. At the same time, the streets (and blogs) are daily dose of trends coming to life each day. Inspiration is everywhere!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to share your style with the world?</strong> I find myself gravitating more and more to personal style blogs because everyone’s style is so unique! I love finding inspiration in other girls’ closets and sharing the pieces of my own that I am loving at the moment. Shopping has become so collaborative through blogs and social platforms; it’s like shopping with hundreds of your closest (internet) friends!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process?</strong> Being a social butterfly, I LOVE social media. (My husband will attest that I am Instagram-obsessed.) I most definitely use all social channels to share my posts, but I also love social media as a medium to connect directly with other bloggers and brands. It is also the perfect way to stay up to date in the blog world while on the go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Blogging has taught me more about branding than I ever could have imagined. When building a personal brand, you truly live and breathe the blog. I hope that Pink Champagne has conveyed my true self to my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over again, would you change anything?</strong> My blog has evolved immensely since it began, and I have loved watching it grow and change with me. The only thing I would change? I would have started sharing outfits and photos of myself much sooner! A strange fear of internet stalkers stopped me from opening up and sharing personal details for far too long.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which outfits are post-worthy?</strong> I think of outfits that I would like to post before I even have an occasion to wear them… is this crazy? I am constantly creating outfits in my mind, and when inspiration strikes it’s time to grab the camera and strike a pose!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own pictures or do you have help? What kind of camera do you recommend?</strong> My husband is the man behind the lens. We first started shooting with my iPhone (shhhh!), but we have since updated to a Nikon Coolpix L320. He is learning with me as we go along, but it is so much fun to shoot with someone that I am so comfortable with. I am so lucky to have such a supportive husband who plays along with my vision and has fun doing it. It also makes for some amazing bloopers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> The friendships that I have made through blogging are by far my favorite part. Meeting girls that I have connected with is always such a treat… everyone is even sweeter and prettier in real life, if that’s possible! I’m always so excited for any event that blogging has opened the door to. I recently attended Charleston Fashion Week, which was a dream come true! Next on my list: New York.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey through Pink Champagne?</strong> I view the world through rose colored sunnies, and I like to think that Pink Champagne sends a positive message. By seeing the beauty around me and sharing what makes me happy, I hope to brighten my readers’ days and inspire them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> It may sound cliché, but BE YOURSELF! With so many blogs today, the only way to be unique is to let your personality shine through. Everyone has their own special style and message, so start sharing ladies!</p>\n"

Learn more about Courtney and her blogging journey through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you have in mind when you started Courtney &amp; Confetti?</strong> I wanted Courtney &amp; Confetti to be a place where people could be inspired. I wanted a place to showcase all of the items in my closet that I love, and to share all of my favorite brands and stores with fellow fashionistas!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with your tagline, “Live Everyday Throwing Confetti”?</strong> Everyone that I come in contact with always comments on how happy I am. A long time ago I made a habit of being in a good mood and not worrying about the small stuff. My hope for everyone is that they can live their life in such a way and, live everyday as if they were throwing confetti.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging? Has it been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> I started blogging in July of 2013 for a company. Interning for them is what sparked my interest in blogging and is what lead me to start Courtney &amp; Confetti. I have been blogging for almost a year and I can say that it has become more than I ever imagined it would be. I had been searching for what felt like the longest time to figure out what I was good at, blogging gave that to me and has fulfilled me in more ways than I could have ever dreamed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over again, would you change anything?</strong> When I started blogging I was not fully committed to it and did not know everything that it took to be successful. I started blogging and thought that I knew everything there was to know but I was truly so clueless. I have come a long way from then though, thankfully! I would have learned the ins and outs of blogging before I started, instead of trying to teach myself while also maintaining Courtney &amp; Confetti.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you initially decide what to post about?</strong> I started my blog with the intentions of it being a fashion blog and knew that I wanted to share all of my favorite pieces in my closet with my viewers, what I was going to post about was actually the one thing I was certain of when I started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?</strong> It is so funny, growing up my parents would always rag on me and say that I was “addicted to clothes” or “all you ever want to do is go shopping”. I was never into sports or crazy about school but I always loved clothes and outfit collaborating. I currently do merchandising, marketing and styling for a company in the town that I go to school at and absolutely love it! If I could do anything in the fashion industry, it would be to have my own line of apparel and accessories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I am definitely very girly. I love heels and wedges and I love getting dressed up. I believe that a good lip color is the best accessory. Anything that is full of bright colors- I want it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> During the fall/winter I love to wear leopard and neutrals. In the spring/summer I go for pinks and white and anything with stripes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I am obsessed with Nordstrom. The place has anything and everything that you could ever need (or want!). I could easily live inside a Nordstrom and forever be a happy girl.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which designers are most inspiring to you?</strong> Kate Spade is my absolute favorite designer. I feel like the whole image of her brand was based around myself. Everything about Kate Spade from her patterns to her famous quotes like “eat cake for breakfast”, represent exactly who I am.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take cues from street style or runway fashion?</strong> I am a sucker for trends because I love experimenting with new things. Since most things on runaway are typically high-end designers, I would say I focus more on street style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My Louis Vuitton tote. I do not use it everyday, but it has saved my life a time or two. If you are going to get a Louis, the Neverfull is without a doubt, your go to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos, or do you have help? Which camera would you recommend?</strong> I have other people take my pictures for me. I have a Nikon DX with a 50mm lens and I love it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> You get out of blogging what you put into it. Weeks where I spend a lot of time working on my blog, something exciting happens. On the weeks where I have a lot going on with school and do not spend as much time on it, I typically do not get the rewards that it brings. Having a blog has also taught me to stay true to myself, and what I like. Blogging has taught me to not let people’s criticism get you down or stop you from doing what your heart desires, chances are, they are not doing what you are doing and they have no idea what goes into it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> It will take more time than you ever imagined. Blogging has truly become my life (no complaints), and you will not get the benefits of blogging if you do not spend a good amount of your time on it. The beginning phases of blogging can get frustrating but everything is a learning process and well worth it. I am a year into blogging and feel like I still have so much to learn.</p>\n"

Her blog is just that, as well as an engaging snapshot of her daily life. Her personal style is a delightful balance of functional and fun, and serves as a guide for sophisticated chic. Get to know Mindy with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I started Arc Line Space Dot at the very beginning of this year. I needed something outside of my day-job to help me stay creative and focused on writing and photography. Blogging helped me do all of that!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> The name comes from one of my favorite authors, Aimee Bender. In her book The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake, the main character says, “I watched as she added a question mark at the end. Arc, line, space, dot.” It seemed like a really fitting name for my blog because I’m always asking questions and think it’s a great way to learn. I also love how her description breaks down something as simple as a question mark into an even more pure form of geometric shapes. In that sense it really captures my love for minimalism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide what to post about?</strong> I try to write about a variety of things from fashion to films to food – and it’s always a balance between what’s going on my head and what’s actually interesting to read about. One thing I try to be conscious about when writing is not pushing products too much. I love shopping, but I don’t think people need buy lots of stuff in order to look or feel great. So I try to mix it up and write about both new and old or borrowed clothes as well as all the other kinds of things we can do to be happy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Functional, but fun. Casual, but chic. Basic, but beautiful. I really believe the most stylish things are simple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Black, white and pastels are my favorites – but with summer fast approaching, white is my go-to. I always feel polished and bright in pure white!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your go-to places to shop and why?</strong> I love Shopbop because they have amazing lookbooks; they also carry my favorite brands, like Alexander Wang, Vince, Club Monaco, Theory, and so many more. They also have free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members. You can’t beat it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are your favorite designers, clothing and otherwise, and why do they inspire you?</strong> I have a special place in my heart for Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Kenzo and Opening Ceremony. My boss, the filmmaker David Lynch, was apparently a big influence for their latest collection - so they asked him to design the runway for the Fall/Winter 2014 show. It was such a joy to get to work with them – and of course, all of their designs are so fresh and fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I love Scandinavian design. They have the best furniture, typography and over-all design sense, which I try to apply to my wardrobe and my life – sometimes more successfully than others! But Scandinavian design is definitely my biggest source of inspiration. It’s functional with a touch of grace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My favorite item is a grey hooded Vince sweater jacket that I got for a steal at Nordstrom Rack. I’ve had it for close to four years, and with the help of a sweater comb, it looks as good as the day I bought it – even though I throw it on with everything. I probably wear it three to four times a week! If I ever lose or wreck it, after I finish crying, I’ll run out and buy another one. (Luckily Vince continues to make a version of it every year. Fweh!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> Too long! I’m a slow writer and a perfectionist, which isn’t a good combination. I don’t know how many times I’ve annoyed my boyfriend by saying, “just 15 more minutes and then I’ll be done,” only to still be working on a post an hour later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos, or do you have help?</strong> I do a lot of the photography myself, but for all the outfit pictures, it’s a joint effort with my boyfriend, Michael. It’s a bit of an unusual process, but we make it work and I’m utterly grateful to him for all the time and effort he puts into my blog. If it weren’t for him, the blog wouldn’t even be possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> You have to enjoy the doing. We really can’t control how our work is received so you have to enjoy doing the work itself. That’s something my boss has always said and the blog has really taught me how practice it. I also think people can tell when something is genuine, so the more you enjoy what you are writing or wearing, the more other people will too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Aside from this interview!? Getting to know really smart, creative women from all around the world has by far been the coolest part of blogging. It’s amazing how many talented people there are out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which social media sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> Instagram and Bloglovin are really important in my blogging process. They are both great ways to connect with other bloggers and drive traffic to your actual blog. Without Instagram or Bloglovin, and now Blogspotter, I’m not sure how we’d find each other!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Don’t worry about numbers. When I first started blogging, I was obsessed with the number of followers or page visits I was getting. But those kinds of markers only bring me fleeting satisfaction. I think it’s more fulfilling to focus on engaging readers in conversation and building relationships. It makes all the work worth it and so much more fun!</p>\n"

Whether they’re splurging at Bloomies or shopping one of Chicago’s local boutiques, Brittani and Katie are shopping and sharing. Learn more about this dynamic duo through their Blogspotter questionnaire.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you found that two heads are better than one when it comes to blogging?</strong> Absolutely! Splitting the fulltime work a blog requires is half the battle. It’s nice to have someone to lean on when meeting tight deadlines and hectic schedules cause some stress; we always know we have each others (and the blogs!) back. Also, having two different perspectives behind one blog definitely keeps things interesting, not just for us, but for our readers as well. In terms of style and personality, we are uniquely different, which helps us reach a broader readership. Coincidently, we also share enough similarities that allow cohesiveness to our content; we’d have to say it’s the best of both worlds!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the beginning stages of your blog. What made you decide to start one together and how did you make initial decisions like name, color scheme, etc.?</strong> The idea for our blog kind of came to us on a whim; we had always been intrigued with fashion and lifestyle blogs and one day thought, why not do it ourselves! With little knowledge or much experience, we launched in November of 2013, and here we are! It was a major learning experience, in the beginning we couldn’t have told you anything about blogging, all we new is that we loved fashion and that was motivation enough to push us through. The toughest part was creating a name for the blog. Your name is everything, it’s your brand - who you are and we wanted to make sure we picked something that spoke to our future readers and ourselves. It was important to us to portray being comfortable in your own skin, which we are, pleasantly petite, and there we had it! We couldn’t be happier with our decision to take a leap of faith into something we weren’t quite familiar with; it has been such a fun journey thus far. As for colors, we wanted something that would catch your eye, but not be too distracting. Thus, our plum / red wine-ish color became our signature color. Picking a color was surprisingly easier than coming up with our name.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post about fashion and lifestyle. What made you decide on these categories?</strong> Our blog has little bit of everything, but focuses on petite fashion and our lives in the city. Being petites ourselves, we sometimes struggle with finding the perfect outfits or fit. Therefore, we wanted to create a forum where people with similar issues could connect, learn and become inspired to dress for their body types or find their perfect style. We also like to give our readers a sneak peak into our lives, connecting with our readers on a more personal level is important to us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would each of you describe your personal style?</strong> We love to try anything once, so you can bet you’ll see a lot of experimenting with different styles on our blog. Katie tends to lean towards a modern bohemian look by mixing fun and relaxed pieces with structured classic ones (think Tory Burch). Brittani likes to incorporate simple girly elements with a bit of an edge (like a mini Kate Moss). However, clothing that makes us feel and look great is always at the top of our list when it comes to choosing an outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you generally on the same page when it comes to fashion, or do you sometimes agree to disagree?</strong> No one person is ever alike and with that comes different opinions. The most important thing to remember is to respect and embrace those differences. Fashion is all about thinking outside the box and we believe agreeing to disagree is a good thing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> About 6 months, we’re in the process of taking the training wheels off now ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that blogging has been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> Yes we do! It has opened our eyes to many possibilities. It showed us how a passion can become a reality with hard work and the motivation for success. Plus, it’s fun! What girl doesn’t love getting dressed up with their best friend on a daily basis?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> It would definitely have to be watching our community of readers grow. It’s awesome knowing that our blog makes a difference and being able to influence and help others is the best feeling! This really rings true when we’re able to be with our readers and community in person at boutique styling events, trade shows or pop up shop openings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Being young twenty something’s (on a budget) we really go for inexpensive chic. Stores such as Zara, Forever 21, Express, Bebe, and J.Crew, are where we find most of our great affordable fashion (and you know the occasional splurge at Nordstrom and Bloomies never hurts!). We also like to keep it local by spending a lot of time in Chicago boutiques; you find the best unique pieces right in your neighborhood. Le Dress in Wicker Park has been a recent go-to for us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Teamwork makes the dream work. Maintaining a blog calls for a lot of dedication and hard work from both of us, although it doesn’t seem like hard work when it’s something you love to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for the future of your blog?</strong> We are small girls with big dreams, so YES! As of right now we are in a re-branding stage for our site and have a lot of new up and coming features to share with our readers, including our very own shop! We are constantly looking for new opportunities to grow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you recommend blogging to other twosomes?</strong> If they’re as lucky as us to be the small percentage of friends who can be business partners, roomies and all around support system, then yes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> Looking back on all the amazing things we’ve accomplished in such a short period of time, we don’t think there is anything we would change. Everything in life is always trial and error! We wouldn’t be where we are today without learning from the experience we’ve had thus far with our blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey through Pleasantly Petite?</strong> Style is a way to express yourself, and being comfortable in what you’re wearing is important. Dress for yourself, and no one else. Even if you think you can’t pull off a certain trend, you never know until you try! We hope to inspire people to take risks but be comfortable in doing so. Life should be a fun fashionable styled ride and that’s what we try to showcase through Pleasantly Petite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> For other fashion bloggers out there, don’t be afraid to showcase the woman behind the clothes. Sharing your life’s ups and downs with your community really creates an intimate experience. Don’t be afraid to lay it all on the line and put yourself out there! You never know where it may get you.</p>\n"

How has it evolved?</strong> Yes, I think my blog has stayed true to the original idea. Although, I have been thinking about adding a few beauty posts. Many people have been asking for a hair tutorial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to share your personal style?</strong> Working from home, I felt like a lot of my cute outfits went to waist. My dogs just didn’t seem to appreciate my good outfits and my husband didn’t have much of an opinion on them either.

I wear a lot of jeans and I’m always in heels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I love Marshalls and TJ Maxx because you can find quality items at great prices. I also love Nordstrom. They always have of-the-moment pieces in a wide price range to fit any budget. Gap and Old Navy are also great.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take more style cues from streetwear or runway fashion?</strong> I definitely get most of my inspiration from street style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I get a lot of inspiration from fashion bloggers, celebrities, and my favorite magazine People StyleWatch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Jeans! My two favorites are my medium wash Dittos jeans and black J Brand jeans. I’m also obsessed with my chambray top.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> I post to all my social media account at least once a day but Instagram is definitely my favorite. Staying active on social media is a very important component of blogging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I can’t really think of anything I would change. I’ve enjoyed every step along the way. If I had to choose something, I wish I would have thought of a more creative blog name. Although, I can’t think of anything I would want to change it to so Kacie’s Kloset it will stay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> The importance of time management. I work from home so it would be easy for me to get distracted by everyday household things. Staying organized and focused is key.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> I know it’s cliché to say but the best advice is to be yourself.

From her teaching wear to party garb, Meg Cady Scholz showcases her style. She describes her look as ever-evolving, which keeps her blog interesting and upbeat. There is never a dull moment at <strong>Everyday Meg</strong>. Get to know the blogger through her daily adventures, her “anti-tutorials”, and her Blogspotter questionnaire, of course!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I’ve been blogging consistently for 2.5 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you start Everyday Meg?</strong> I had started a blog in college to chronicle my adventures in student teaching, but I soon realized that the stories I had to write weren’t exactly Internet appropriate I put the blog on the backburner. I picked it back up in the Fall of 2010 when I accepted my first job teaching in a town of 956 people it was basically the only way I could interact with anyone above the age of 12 and below the age of 60!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started your blog, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong> When I started Everyday Meg I had no plan, no vision, no real purpose. It has evolved into so much more than I could have ever dreamed!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> Between photos and editing and content I spend anywhere between 1.5-2 hours per post!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog and your tagline “snap, sparkle, savor”?</strong> The name I originally started this blog under wasn’t my favorite and as I began to explore what I wanted out of blogging I realized that I wanted people to be able to do “Everyday Life” with me, so Everyday Meg it was! Being an English teacher I have a thing for alliteration so I knew that I wanted to incorporate the three of my favorite things in a catchy way!</p>\n\n<p><strong>As a teacher by day and photographer by night, how do you also find time to blog?</strong> I make time. Honestly, it is the most cathartic thing I do all day. I ALWAYS feel better after I hit the publish button.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to blog about fashion, food, and photography?</strong> Those are the three things I go to bed thinking of and what get me out of that same bed in the morning. I don’t see fashion as just clothes I see it as a reflection of a person’s soul. I don’t see food as just fuel I see it as a person’s heart on a plate (oh what imagery there!) and I see photography as a way to capture both of those things in a silent still moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Evolving. One of my favorite stories to tell is of a 13 year old male student who just couldn’t wrap his head around my style. One day he finally had had it and blurts out in the middle of class “CAN’T YOU JUST PICK ONE TYPE OF STYLE PLEASE — one day you’re all preppy and the next you look like a hippie so weird.” So I’m going to say evolving - I’ll stick with evolving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does your teacher wear differ much from other outfit choices?</strong> I am pretty frugal, so if I can throw a cardigan or a pair of tights on with an outfit to wear to school it is a keeper. Some of my favorite outfits have either been “school” outfits that have gotten adapted for “real” life or vice versa!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> A good tailored blazer and a white t-shirt (and earrings, can I add jewelry? Because I don’t go ANYWHERE without earrings). They are quintessential transition pieces! They can transition any outfit from season to season or day to night!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite subject to post about and why?</strong> I love doing “anti-tutorials”, the basic idea is saying, “Hey ya’ll, I’m Meg and I have no idea what I am doing and make a lot of mistakes, but you can totally learn from me!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Starting a blog has taught me that opportunities are everywhere. It is easy to get pulled in a million different directions and to lose your way but staying true to yourself is the only way you can be happy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Hands down (Dashboard confessional Anyone?), it has been meeting some of the most inspirational women on this planet. Many of them have become my close personal friends. In fact, I was just a bridesmaid in a blog friends wedding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> Oh, this one is tough. I would love to be all “No Regrets y’all” but there are several posts and silly things I did at the beginning of blogging that weren’t really me… so I would be lying if I said “no regrets” but I do feel like I have learned from all those experiences to become the blogger I am today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Do something different. In a world where it is increasingly harder to be an individual do things because you want to do them not because everyone else is! In other words… you do you!</p>\n"

The Star Valley, Wyoming native is not only a fashion and style blogger, she’s a cosmetologist and makeup artist (she’s really amazing!). Kayla adores cowboy boots, prefers matte finishes over metallic, opts for pops of pink over pops of yellow (but it’s a close call!), and lives by the quote “the only person I’m trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday”. And sassy is OK, as long as it’s mixed with an equal part of classy. Meet the stunning blonde behind Boots Class &amp; A lil Sass with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your blog, “Boots Class &amp; A Lil Sass” (cutest name, ever!)</strong> Thank you! Well I’m from a small town in Wyoming; I have always had a passion for fashion. I would constantly go to the local grocery store to buy magazines (the closest ‘city’ was 2 hours away) so I would find anyway to stay up-to-date on the latest fashion &amp; beauty trends. Then I went to become a cosmetologist &amp; makeup artist, dashed in with a few other professions. The Boots Class &amp; A lil Sass came from my LOVE for cowboy boots, a reminder to always be classy &amp; a maybe just a little bit sassy… but always in a cute fun way!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re absolutely stunning - and we love your golden-girl-meets-sassy-chic style. What made you want to start blogging?</strong> Awe well thank you so much! Well I started my blog more as a self-expression and I wanted to share my love for fashion &amp; beauty with others. If I could give any fashion inspiration to anyone or any makeup tips &amp; someone benefited from them, it makes it all worthwhile!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You have such an interesting background! How do you balance everything so well? Any tips regarding time management?</strong> If it’s important to you, you will make time. I grew up with a dad who is such an incredibly hard worker &amp; I rarely saw him complain. He managed his time by making what he did a priority. I guess I picked that up &amp; it motivated me use my time wisely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your outfits always incorporate flowing long blonde hair and bold accessory accents. If you only had one must-wear accessory in your closet, what would it be - and why?</strong> My bracelet stacks, for sure. They can be dressed up or dressed down. A good set of bracelets go with anything!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did you grow up? Does location heavily influence your style?</strong> Star Valley, Wyoming. Absolutely, my favorite outfits reflect from being from Wyoming. A little western-rustic-casual vibe is my fave!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “The only person I’m trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday.” It’s important to only be in competition with yourself, and to push yourself everyday to be a better person. Also it’s incredibly important to ALWAYS be yourself - everyone else is already taken.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>What websites or blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> I love ModaMob.com, Polyvore, Pinterest of course, &amp; following tons of style bloggers</td>\n      <td>stores on instagram!</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?</strong> Turks &amp; Caicos</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Crisp white tee, distressed cut offs, cowboy boots or converse, killer bracelet stacks, long stacked dainty necklaces</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glitter or sequins?</strong> Sequins</p>\n\n<p><strong>A pop of pink or yellow?</strong> This is tricky… pink!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Metallic or matte?</strong> Matte</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you ever reach out to other bloggers for advice or networking? Have you made blogger friends in the industry? If so, how did you go about doing that?</strong> When I first started out, I reached out to a few bloggers (some who never responded) but I didn’t get discouraged, the ones who did were so nice &amp; helpful. Most bloggers have a ‘contact me’ on their site so it made it easy to shoot a message and get some advice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding Boots Class &amp; A Lil Sass?</strong> Instagram and Pinterest by far! Yes - absolutely it helps!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> How much work goes into a blog and building up your site. The time that is put in to making it reflect who you are as a blogger and a person. The importance of details and making sure you never lose sight of who you are and the reason why you started blogging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of must-have advice you would give her?</strong> To not give up, it doesn’t matter how many readers you have as long as you are fulfilling what you set out to do with your blog. If you stay true to yourself and the blog you poured your heart into, it will pay off. When you receive that first email or comment from someone asking how you did your hair or where you got that certain accessory or any advice, I promise you will get such a sense of reassurance and pride in what you’re doing. It makes it that much more meaningful. Xoxo babes!</p>\n"

She plans to live it up every moment, and who wouldn’t want to live vicariously through her detailed posts? Learn more about Emi and her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you discover that you wanted to blog about food, travel and lifestyle?</strong> I’ve always loved to document. When my husband and I got married and moved away, I started to blog about our life and that naturally included food &amp; travel because they are a big part of our lives. Travel is my very favorite thing, and whenever I visit a new place I love finding favorites and collecting them, writing them down, and sharing them. Lots of friends would ask me to send them my guides when they were planning trips. As I kept our personal blog up, my husband asked why I didn’t post some of my guides on it. I quickly discovered how fun it was to share my favorite places, food, &amp; sights and connect with other people with similar interests because who doesn’t love food and travel? I knew there were lots of blogs out there, but I had found a topic and platform that was perfect for me – plus, it ties in naturally to our life and I can still document our big and small adventures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I started blogging right when I got married in June 2012, and we bought the Well-Traveled Wife domain in January 2013. It has been almost a year and a half with the Well-Traveled Wife!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started The Well Traveled Wife, what did you have in mind?</strong> When I started The Well-Traveled Wife, I mostly wanted to continue documenting and sharing our adventures and favorite finds, create travel guides and tips for favorite destinations, and partner with fun businesses to promote them. I wanted to create a brand that is trusted for recommendations and share our love of life, food, travel, and adventure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea? How has it evolved?</strong> I feel lucky that it has stayed true to my ideas for the blog. Blogs can be tricky because there are so many, and lots of times people compare to other blogs, etc. I want my blog to be something that helps others have fun and eat well, but also documents our life and reflects us. I try to keep it pretty balanced between personal posts and guides/ tips/ reviews/ favorite recipes… Hopefully there’s something for everyone!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has become your favorite subject to post about?</strong> I love telling stories from our adventures and being able to look back on them later. Writing about a trip takes me back to the place and helps the experience live on!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find inspiration for your posts?</strong> I find inspiration in my everyday experiences, thoughts, favorites, finds, and adventures. I share what I love, what I think, what I recommend, what I want to remember. I love reading other blogs and how real they are, so I try to stay real and mix up my posts based on what’s going on in my life. When I’m traveling and learn something new or think of a tip that I use, I want to write about it and share it! Same goes for when I eat great food or try a new experience - I want to send others to do the same! It’s one of my favorite things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide where you’re going to eat or travel next?</strong> My “places to travel” and “restaurants to try” lists are never ending! My husband and I prioritize our travel destinations based on the best places to go at the moment - places that are less expensive, or places that are better to travel to right now when we’re young without kids. For example, this year we went all through China because we thought - this flight / country / crazy itinerary would be much harder one day with kids so we want to do it now! As for eating, we love to try all different food - we usually pick restaurants based on reviews, recommendations, or plans with friends so they help us decide. We have a few staples, but I almost always want to try a new place when we go out to eat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> This really depends on the post… sometimes I sit down and the words fly, the pictures go together perfectly, and it’s done. Other times I spend time editing and combining photos, putting thought into every word and photo arrangement. I’d say they take around an hour from start to finish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you ever switch the focus of your blog to another subject, or start a different one?</strong> I hope to keep my blog consistent and focused in the same niche, but maybe one day when we have kids it will obviously shift and could be more about “The Well-Traveled Family” or traveling with kids! I love my blog and feel like it represents me well, so I don’t plan to change the focus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> Definitely getting asked to film a travel show for PBS in Cannon Beach, Oregon. We got to invite 2 of our best couple friends for a week with everything provided as we filmed the show. The show had us do the best Cannon Beach had to offer, from surfing lessons to beach yoga to cooking classes to glass blowing. It was when I realized that blogs can bring such amazing opportunities and help pipe dreams come true!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> I think social media plays a big part in everything these days. It is a great way to connect and different people follow on different outlets. I love working with businesses over social media and collaborating, because when we share each other’s pages it’s a win-win. Facebook and Bloglovin’ are probably the best for sharing recent posts, Pinterest is HUGE for gaining new readers, and of course I love Instagram and twitter. It’s all about balancing the flow and sharing in the right doses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I don’t think so! It has been great and grown at the right pace for me - I would just tell myself to not worry about other blogs or comparing, but just be myself and enjoy having a creative outlet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> 1. Blogging takes a lot of work, but if you truly love what you’re blogging about it doesn’t feel like work at all. 2. I’ve learned that if you put in time and effort, you see results. New readers come, businesses reach out, and success happens. 3. At the end of the day, no matter how many readers/followers you have, you need to be happy in your own life - don’t let the blog take over or paint an unrealistic picture - just let it be an inspiring, honest, helpful, memorable place for you and others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to readers through The Well Traveled Wife?</strong> I love this life and want to live up every second of it. I want readers to do the same. I want to convey that you should never miss the opportunity to see something that is beautiful. That you should never stop exploring. That nothing matters without family + friends. That you can explore and have adventures near or far from home. That you should eat well, and travel often.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> 1. Do it for the right reasons. If you start a blog, do it for the right reason - because you love it! We all know there are amazing benefits and opportunities that come from blogging, but don’t start it for those reasons. Start it because you are passionate about it and love doing it, even if no one ever read it. 2.Be consistent. You don’t need to post every single day, but however often you post - do it consistently. Whether it’s daily or weekly, it keeps you coming back and provides readers with structure. 3. Be brave! Once you get going, the sky is the limit. Don’t be afraid to contact companies, network, try for opportunities. You might be surprised at the doors that open! When I contacted my first restaurant to do a feature, I thought they would never respond… I couldn’t believe when they invited us to come in and work together! The hundreds of partnerships we’ve had since then have come from that first brave step. 4. Don’t let it take over your life. Don’t do things just so they can “be on the blog.” Don’t talk about it all the time. Don’t obsess over numbers or comments. Just do it because you enjoy it, document things, love it, and have it be an amazing outlet and part of life.</p>\n"

Instead of writing about how a quote inspires her, she now shows us her daily inspirations. From home decor to outfit choices to favorite products, Just Peachy is a peek into Rachel’s peachy Georgia life. Learn more about her and her blogging journey through her Blogspotter questionnaire.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I’ve been blogging since I was a Junior in college – so 4 years now! But I took a year off when I graduated so I consider it about 3 years total.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you start Just Peachy?</strong> I originally started Just Peachy as a quote journal where I would post a quote, then right a little paragraph about how it applied to my life. This blog exists no longer, but it was my entry into the blog world. When I saw how many other people were sharing their lives I thought – this is cool, I can do this too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I’m from Georgia, so that makes me a Georgia Peach – hence the peachy. And I have a pretty optimistic outlook on life so everything is always “just peachy!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started Just Peachy, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong> When I first started, I shared a whole lot more of my personal life and what I was doing every weekend. Since I was in college and in a sorority, I always had something going on. And when I started that’s what most blogs were about – just life and what was happening. Then when I graduated from college, I started working and didn’t have a lot of time to blog and I definitely wasn’t as social as I was in college so it kind of evolved into just fashion and what I like to shop for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in clothing, shopping and styling?</strong> Always! When I was younger I would dress up my sister in different outfits and take pictures of her like mini photo shoots. But I was also a huge tomboy up until I moved to Georgia – as in only Nike, Adidas and sweatpants and tennis shoes to school. I was at the mall every weekend in middle school and was nominated for best dressed in high school! I also won a fashion marketing competition in high school and I minored in fashion merchandising in college. When I graduated, I went on to become the Marketing Manager for a popular chain of boutiques. So yes, my whole life has involved fashion!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you like to explore any other aspects of the fashion industry?</strong> I’ve been in Fashion Marketing professionally and that’s a huge passion of mine, but I really want to be in styling. I want to be able to go out and shop for a client and be her fashion guardian angel! I love putting outfits together and giving advice for what to wear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Such a hard question! I don’t really have a name for it. It’s like preppy-hipster-chic. I like pieces that I can wear to all kinds of events and I’m also very casual. I don’t like stilettos but I love wedges and I love oversized tees and skinny jeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> J.Crew and Madewell hands down. I’d say 85% of my closet is from these 2 stores. Granted, I used to work at J.Crew so it holds a special place in my heart. Plus, J.Crew is my workday saving grace. I would wear plain black slacks and a white blouse to work every day if it weren’t for J.Crew. I love the easy, casual, tomboy-ish charm of Madewell and that’s my weekend wear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> My favorite colors to wear are black, gray, blue, and coral. I have way too many striped shirts. I also love embroidered Aztec pieces – they’re my weakness!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Chambray shirt, striped tee, black skinnies, and my Tory Burch flats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which outfits are post-worthy?</strong> If it’s something that I know others will wear, I’ll post it, especially if there’s something a little different about it like camo with hot pink and heels or florals with stripes. I tend to post only what I think is wearable for many people and with pieces that are easy to find or recreate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> An average blog post takes about an hour to take, but an outfit post will take much longer. Between getting ready, getting dressed, taking the photos, and writing about it I would say it takes about 3 hours! It’s definitely not a spur of the moment decision to take an outfit post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos, or do you have help? What kind of camera do you recommend?</strong> I take my own photos with a DSLR, tripod, and remote. I wish I had someone to take all my photos! It’s especially embarrassing when someone walks up on you taking pictures of yourself… I recently upgraded from the Nikon D40 to the Canon Rebel T3i and I am obsessed. I definitely recommend the Canon!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like Just Peachy to convey to your readers?</strong> That clothes are fun, they show your personality, and you can look cute putting basics together in a fresh way! I want to my outfits to be wearable so that other readers can relate to me or get outfit ideas!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> Just have fun with it. Don’t go into it with the goal of being “famous” or making money – then it will feel like a chore and you won’t make friends. That’s my second piece of advice – make friends! Follow tons of people on Twitter and Instagram and talk to them! I’ve made some of my best friends through blogging.</p>\n"

See Jyotsna’s varying outfit repertoire, take a peek at her beauty favorites, and get a behind-the-scenes look at her fashionable life. Learn more about her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long ago did you start Cuppajyo?</strong> I started Cuppajyo in November 2013.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started your blog, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong> I was always passionate about fashion and all things related to lifestyle from fashion and beauty to food and fitness. This is the reason I called my blog Cuppajyo; literally meaning a cup of Jyo  (everyone calls me that) so that I could write about everything that inspires me in fashion, beauty and lifestyle. So far, I would say I have been true to the original idea since I make sure to have different categories like outfits, beauty tips, DIY, beauty/product/service reviews, etc. But I predominantly focus on fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to share your outfits, inspirations, and style advice with the world?</strong> A couple of my friends have always asked me for fashion and beauty advice whether it was being a shopping partner, suggestions for outfits, makeup tips etc. It gave me great joy to help them out as well as satisfy my ultimate wish to be a stylist. This is when I started posting outfits on Chictopia and Instagram, which got good response, ultimately encouraging me to start Cuppajyo!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> It’s been a great experience so far. I have met and worked with so many interesting people through blogging! I have developed so many skills and gained a lot of valuable experiences through blogging as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> For now I think I wouldn’t change anything since my blog is just around 6 months old, and I hope I can give the same answer even a few years down the line!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I tend to gravitate towards more feminine and colorful attire, both in clothes and accessories. However, I love to be adventurous in my style, so I am not afraid to try other styles like bohemian, minimalistic, etc. It all depends on my mood! But at the end of the day, its all about me being comfortable and feeling like a million bucks in whatever I am wearing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> I have so many favorite colors: aquamarine wins first place, but I also love red, coral, mint, cobalt blue, black, ivory (the list can go on but I’ll stop there). I love adding bold pops of color like a bold lip or a bold statement shoe or clutch.</p>\n\n<p>As for patterns I absolutely love leopard and stripes; I consider them neutrals! They are so versatile. You can dress them up or dress them down, as well as use them as a base for a pattern mix. I also love floral patterns and any statement pattern likes a gorgeous graphic print.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Some of my favorite places to shop online: Lulus, Nasty Gal (they have an amazing selection of clothing, shoes and accessories); Etsy, Ebay (for accessories); Sheinside, Romwe (amazing selection of clothes for incredible prices!)</p>\n\n<p>Some of my favorite physical stores to shop at: Marshalls, TJMaxx ( love me a good deal! And you can never go wrong with these two!); H&amp;M, Forever21 (again I’m all in for looking trendy without breaking the wallet!); Jcrew, Zara.\nI also love shopping at a lot of local boutiques in Boston. I think it’s important to support local stores. Also, the added advantage is that you will always find unique, one-of-a-kind pieces in boutiques that would be sure to stand out in your outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> If I were to pick 5 items I cant live without: my favorite pair of jeans, LBD, basic white tee, nude flats and my Ray-Ban aviators!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process?</strong> Yes, it definitely does! Social media is such a powerful tool when you are trying to get your name out there. There are so many blogs today, and the only way to can get known or be noticed is being consistent and persistent, both on social media as well as other online communities relevant to your genre of blogging. Social media definitely takes a lot of time, so my advice would be to concentrate on the 1 or 2 platforms that you want to market your brand on the most. My favorite social media platform is Instagram.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> If its an outfit post, the cumulative time of taking pictures, editing them and writing the post takes me about 2 hours. If it’s a just a review, a DIY post etc where its mostly just pictures and written content, the post takes me about an hour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite subject to post about?</strong> Fashion is undoubtedly my favorite subject to post about. I love to put together outfits, and I hope that my readers can gain some inspiration from them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> I have learnt a couple of things being 6 months into blogging now. First up, blogging is a lot more than just looking pretty and rosy, it is a lot of work from the very first step of building your website and it is always a work in progress. Being true to your goal, being patient and not getting bogged down by numbers and delivering good content is key to maintaining a good brand image. Networking with other bloggers and industry professionals is very helpful in getting your name out there and growing your blog. Seriously there are so many amazing bloggers out there, every time I meet someone new I am so inspired by them! Finally, being engaged and interactive with your followers and supporters is also very important.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I am extremely grateful to all my readers and followers both on my blog as well as on social media. The support has been incredible to a newbie like me, I am so deeply appreciative. I hope I can continue to inspire you all and a lot more with my cup of Jyo!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> If you are really passionate or motivated about starting your blog, there is nothing stopping you! It took me a couple of months to contemplate and muster the courage to take this step, but I am really glad I took the plunge! But as I had mentioned earlier, if you want to make a name for yourself, be prepared to work hard, be consistent and persistent. Of course there are a lot of freebies and small bouts of fame, but that shouldn’t be why you are in it. Being patient, dedicated and passionate about what you do will definitely give you a lot more pleasure and a greater sense of fulfillment. I wish all the aspiring bloggers the best of luck! xoxo</p>\n"

Her bright, cheerful style shines in every post. She looks to movies and music for ideas, and cites Olivia Palermo as street style inspiration. Learn more about Shelby and It’s My Lucky Day through her Blogspotter questionnaire. Maybe some of that luck will rub off!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us why it’s your lucky day!</strong> Here’s the thing – I have this really comical way of winning random contests. I’ve won everything from gift cards to concert tickets and even a trip to Chicago. A lot of my close friends are always like, “You’re literally the luckiest girl EVER”, and so that’s kind of how “It’s My Lucky Day” came about. I wanted a place to share my adventures, and my blog was the perfect opportunity for me to do so!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you choose the name and color scheme for your blog?</strong> About a year ago, I sort of recreated my blog. I had tried blogging for a while, but it was never anything consistent, and I felt like my themes really didn’t match my personality. That changed after my friend and I watched the 2013 Kentucky Derby, and there was a horse named “It’s My Lucky Day.” We both looked at each other and knew that it was a perfect fit for me! I shorten it sometimes to just “Lucky Day”, but I love that it captures my personal style. To me, it’s all about having fun and embracing those moments of good luck. I chose an aqua blue hue because, frankly, I’m a little obsessed with the color. I also love that it gives a fresh and lively feel, complimented by the gold glitter accents that add just the right amount of sparkle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the process of curating your lively and preppy closet?</strong> I always look for pieces that have a classic appeal with a colorful twist. I love pieces that speak for themselves, like a bright pair of patterned jeans or a bold statement necklace. Being a Florida native, I can get away with wearing these saturated hues all year, making it easy for me to keep my closet lively! When in doubt, I take a note from my prep-school days and go for a solid oxford button-down shirt and a pair of colored chino shorts. I’d have to say that’s probably my signature look!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> I find inspiration everywhere! I often look to movies or music to inspire me. My blog is dedicated to my personal style, so I follow a few fashion blogs and keep an updated mood board on Pinterest to help me stay inspired.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you use blogging as a creative outlet?</strong> Definitely! I love anything that allows me to express a little creativity, and Lucky Day is no exception! I strive to reflect my creativity and personal style in each and every post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will your style change at all when you graduate college and officially join the workforce?</strong> I feel like my style has changed a lot already since I came to college, but I think that just depends on the career path I take. I know it will change because I’m always updating my closet, but to say my everyday looks will become more “professional” would probably be incorrect. If anything, I think my personal style will become a little more refined than it is now!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any outfit tips for college grads interviewing or starting their first jobs?</strong> I think the best way advice would be to find a balance between looking professional and adding your own flair. I don’t think work-appropriate attire has to be boring! When in doubt, check and see if the company you’re interviewing with has a dress code policy and go from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is your fashion sense more girly or tomboy chic?</strong> My style is definitely on the girlier side, but I like to incorporate a few tomboy elements every now and then. I adore anything that has ruffles, sparkle, or a hint of pink. Although, I’m also one to rock a pair of camo skinny pants every once in a while. I think it’s fun to mix things up and wear pieces that are a little out of the ordinary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Heels or flats?</strong> Heels are pretty, but my shoes of choice are my worn-in Jack Rogers sandals!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you shop more in small boutiques or department stores?</strong> I prefer shopping in boutiques because I feel like they offer more unique looks. I have my fair share of basics from department stores, but somehow I’m always drawn to those pieces in my wardrobe that are from local boutiques. I love having pieces that no one else has!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is your number one style icon?</strong> Right now, I’m totally crushing on Blair Eadie from Atlantic-Pacific’s style. I love how she puts together unexpected pieces and patterns. She’s fearless! I’m also a huge fan of Olivia Palermo. Her street style is flawless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What three items in your closet could you never replace?</strong> My Kate Spade glitter heels, Jackie O pearls, and my Carrie Bradshaw tulle skirt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has updating and maintaining your blog taught you?</strong> I think the most important thing that I’ve learned through writing on Lucky Day is that you should always remain true to yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in the latest blogger trends and post about what everyone else is posting, but I’ve learned that blogging is more rewarding when you’re posting creative content. You can’t go wrong when you’re being yourself! Your readers will for sure appreciate the originality.</p>\n"

Her looks are ever evolving. Catch her right now in a “feminine but utilitarian” phase. Whether she’s sporting athletic wear or a sophisticated ensemble, Bethann shines. Learn more about her blogging journey through her Blogspotter questionnaire.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I started in January 2013 because I was working with fashion bloggers on account of my professional role. I wanted to better understand what they do and how they do it. I wanted to have the same challenges they did so I could find ways to overcome those challenges professionally. What surprised me, however, was that I LOVED doing it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Colleagues of mine came up with the name “Bethanimal” years ago and I’ve always had a thing for animal print so I played a little word chemistry and came up with Bethanimal Print.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With a busy lifestyle, how do you find time to blog?</strong> When I am not sleeping, I am working. I get energized by the time spent on my blog. It never seems like work to me. The day it starts to feel like work to me (or to my husband who takes my photos) we will call it a day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> My outfit posts take 2.5 hours and my workout posts are more in depth, so those take about 3.5 - 4 hours, plus I’m sore for several days afterward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started BethAnimalPrint, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original ideal?</strong> My priority was to learn what responsibilities a fashion blogger has and I have a better idea of that now. At this point, I’m just doing it because it brings a lot of joy to my life by giving me the opportunity to express myself and build community.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I am familiar with the landscape, my goals have expanded and I want to help women, especially other moms, find pieces that work for their lifestyles and budgets. I hope to inspire at least one person to feel confident with their existing wardrobe. Chances are that most women have some fun, eclectic pieces in their closet which can be repurposed for new life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to blog about fashion and fitness?</strong> Both to learn more about the industry and to appease my Facebook friends who would post “where did you get that?” or “what is your workout routine?” on my photos. Granted, most of them don’t care. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Ever-evolving. Right now it is feminine but utilitarian. I’m at this point in my life where clothes need it to be functional so I can chase my 2-year-old when she tries to run toward traffic. The feminine part comes from having my daughter as well. I used to scoff at full skirts and pink, but now I get it. They are simply whimsical.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?</strong> I transformed my receiving blankets in to skirts, dresses and hats when I was a toddler. We didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up, so I updated hand-me-downs from friends and family with new buttons or a more modern neckline.</p>\n\n<p>I studied Fashion Merchandising in college and am totally interested in most aspects of the industry. Right now I am working with fashion vloggers and brands at YouTube.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process?</strong> Sure, I find new products on Twitter or Pinterest and new influencers on Instagram weekly. All of that plays a role in how my own style will evolve and how much time I have to post… Instagram can take hours out of my week!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I would have started much earlier. Someone close to me once said “it is really difficult to be the best when you are playing catch up” and that resonated with me because the competitive side of me wants to be really good at this even though the rest of me would do this even if nobody read it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> The SF fashion blogging community is quite welcoming and I’ve been fortunate to make a few strong relationship with successful and admirable women from blogging. I never knew I could build community this way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Besides animal print, what are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> I love any color that makes an impact, yellow and cobalt are my favorite right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there certain pieces or looks that feel very you?</strong> A bitchin’ moto jacket. I am trying to convince my husband to bless me pulling the trigger on a black one (it’s absurdly overpriced). They immediately make any outfit so much cooler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Thank you so much for reading! I want this to be inspirational to you no matter what stage of life you are in and I hope this blog empowers you to wear and do anything you want.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> If you don’t love it, don’t do it. It’s a lot of work and a thankless endeavor.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>A champagne problem is defined as “The need to make a decision where both alternatives are desirable.” <strong>Dana Mannarino</strong> runs into a lot of these with her blog <strong>Pink Champagne Problems</strong>. She posts for herself and her own happiness and her true passion shines through. Her preppy with a pinch of edge personal style is unique and refreshing. Learn more about Dana and her Pink Champagne Problems with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I have been blogging since September 2012!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you start Pink Champagne Problems?</strong> I originally started Pink Champagne Problems as part of my university’s student blogging program. It was all about Marymount and a fashion student’s perspective, but I soon felt that I wasn’t being super true to myself by only talking about my school. So, I started talking outfit pictures and the rest is kind of history!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I was sitting in Shake Shack in Washington D.C., and I said something absolutely ridiculous – and my friend said, “That’s such a champagne problem.” And that’s really how Pink Champagne Problems was born (the pink was added because… well why not?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore any other aspects of the industry?</strong> I don’t think there was a time in my life when I doubted that I would end up in the fashion industry. My older sister currently works in the fashion industry, and I definitely want to follow in her footsteps. So far, I would like to explore these areas – Merchandising, Public Relations, Marketing/Social Media, and Sales/Buying. Fingers crossed that I’ll land a job in one of these fields by graduation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Over the past few years, my style has evolved into a pretty classic niche. I tend to buy pieces that I know I will be able to wear for years. I’d like to say that I gravitate towards the preppy looks, but like to add my own flare to it – which might be a random edgy piece or a crazy statement necklace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does living in New York City influence your style at all?</strong> Absolutely. It’s the most diverse city in the world when it comes to fashion. Sometimes I’ll walk past someone and be like, “Wow, she looks great! How in the world does she pull that off?” I wish I had the guts to ask people where they bought some of their things!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> J.Crew is my absolute favorite store (over half my wardrobe is definitely J.Crew). I can find everything I need there, and it really compliments my style – especially since they’re trying to be more edgy while remaining true to the classic prep look. I’ve also been really impressed with Loft lately! And ASOS and Zara are my go-tos when I need some edgy inspiration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey via Pink Champagne Problems?</strong> I’m just an average 21 year old college senior. I don’t have the money to buy big-ticket items, and I certainly don’t have a big enough following for a ton of brands to sponsor my blog by giving me products to style. But you know what? I’m okay with that. I genuinely love writing and blogging and sharing what inspires me with my readers. I really believe that fashion is my passion and if I could inspire a few people by what I wear, that’s super awesome – and most of the time my readers give me some kind of inspiration too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Pinterest. Other bloggers. My sister (that girl can pull off ANYTHING).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process?</strong> Absolutely. I use Twitter and Facebook to post links to my blog posts. I use Instagram to highlight my outfit posts. I’ve been starting to use Pinterest more to pin the looks from my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much does street style influence you? How much does runway fashion influence you?</strong> I’d say street style doesn’t influence me all that much, aside from admiring the looks. I don’t really remember what I see on the streets, so I don’t think about trying to recreate a look. Runway fashion definitely influences my style because it’s where trends and color palates are created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to feature other bloggers in some of your posts?</strong> I really love how many amazing people I’ve met through blogging! I think it switches things up a bit – do people really want to read what I have to say every day?! It also is a great way to gain a bigger following, and also introduce my readers to new bloggers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I would probably start doing outfit posts from the beginning. I realized I could have established a blog image of being a fashion blogger then, instead of almost a year later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Seriously, how many amazing people I’ve “met” through blogging and social media. I’ve become more confident in my blog, and love connecting with other bloggers. Some of us are even looking to meet up this summer, which I’m really excited about!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Just go for it and have fun. You’re not going to see results overnight, but if it’s something you’re truly passionate about, you’ll find it easy to blog for yourself and for your happiness – the readers will come along.</p>\n"

After being asked “Where did you get that?” way too often, she decided to give the world an answer. To visit her collection of personal style is to be inspired by her sophisticated yet comfy chic looks. Be sure to do so and learn more about Mo through her Blogspotter questionnaire.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> About 2 years</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started Belle of the Bean, what did you have in mind?</strong> To share my personal style with the world and to answer a question that I often get – “Where did you get that?”</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Just some thought… I wanted something that included my hometown. Some of us refer to Boston as “The Bean” (short for Beantown).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I like to flip through fashion magazines to see what the latest trends are but I usually go with what works best for my body type. Being petite, I can’t wear every single trend, regardless if I love it. I also love Christine Centenera. She’s just so effortlessly chic!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong>\nI love color-blocking, mixing prints/patterns and adding just a pop of color to an otherwise monochromatic look.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> H&amp;M, Arden B., ASOS, Armani Exchange, Nordstrom. I’m super petite and wear size 34/4 in shoes so these stores all carry the latest styles in sizes that fit and flatter my body type. Nordstrom is the only department store that carries shoes in my size and their customer service is exceptional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which city’s style do you feel encapsulates your own?</strong> I think LA. Weirdly, I get asked if I’m from California a lot. I would say I’m pretty laid back so cut-off shorts, a loose tee and sandals seem to be my uniform in the summertime. Every time it snows, my inner Cali-girl always asks, “Why do you live here?” But I love Boston.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My “destroyed” Hudson Jeans. They’re the most comfortable pair of jeans I’ve ever owned. Thongs – TMI I know, but I despise panty lines and “wedgies.” High heels – because I’m a shorty. Chambray shirt because it can be worn so many ways and can be dressed up or down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I usually dress according to my mood, but I would say it’s usually comfy-chic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a look or piece that feels very you when you wear it?</strong> In the Summer I like to wear denim shorts with a long sleeve top to take me into the breezy nights and maybe a fedora and/or a pair of shades.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> I’m a huge fan of Coco Chanel. Her pieces are like works of art and timeless. And those handbags are to die for!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you go about selecting outfits worthy of posting?</strong> I usually go with the ones where I can link the item to be purchased or to a similar item. A lot of times my readers want to know where they can get a specific piece and I like to be able to direct them to it through my links.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long does an average blog post take?</strong> About 45 minutes depending on how much media I’m including in the post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I’m forever grateful and so appreciative for the support and interest in my blog, especially being a fairly new blogger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> Stay true to yourself and post what you like, not what you think your readers will like. When you’re not being yourself it usually doesn’t end well. Be interactive with readers/fellow bloggers who support your blog. Also if you are patient and dedicated to your blog, you will eventually get the results that you want.</p>\n"

See Caroline’s favorite shoes, jewelry, beauty products, etc. via Style on the Side. Learn more about her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I have been blogging for about 1 1/2 years now about 1 year seriously. I’ve always loved writing and photography and this seemed like the perfect outlet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you decide on a name for your blog?</strong> The first name I had was Girl In The Yellow Dress and that name came from a tv commercial that inspired me. When I decided to blog on a more serious level I realized that branding would be a crucial part of my success. Girl In The Yellow Dress was too long and taken on most social media outlets. Since I blog mainly about accessories and beauty I started throwing together different thoughts and words. The idea that emerged was that I blog about all the things that compliment your main outfit and that’s how Style On The Side was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about style, beauty, and lifestyle. Why did you want to cover these categories and more?</strong> Simply, as much as I love clothing, I love all the other “things” even more. I obsess about beautiful bags and hats. I can’t walk by store without taking a second look at a scarf. Put me in front of a beauty counter and I am mesmerized by the colours. I spent a great deal of my childhood traveling and a big part of that was learning to observe people, to pay attention to architecture and the beauty of everyday. I want to celebrate all of that with this blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Simple, classic and vintage inspired. I like clean straight cuts. This forms the canvass to display beautiful jewelry, bags and shoes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to focus on shoes, bags and accessories?</strong> I believe that a great classic bag, shoe or piece of jewelry will never really go out of style. Trends may come and go but I’ve had several of these key pieces of years and I still wear them proudly. I want this to reflect on my blog, I’m not interested in jumping on the “latest and greatest” bandwagon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog is more writing-based than a typical personal style blog. Why is this?</strong> I think because it’s not just a personal style blog. I’ve always loved combining the written word with images. Writing allows me to delve deeper into the products I choose to showcase on my blog and to share a personal point of view.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you feel that your blog differs from others?</strong> I make an effort to use my own photography. I would say that 98% of the images are taken by me. I approach fashion and style from a different angle.\nI’d like to think of myself as a fashion explorer who is on a journey to discover beautiful things and to share them with my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you choose products and styles worthy of writing about?</strong> I am passionate about new and wonderful discoveries. I am passionate about great design. Something has to spark my interest for me to want to write about it. Sometimes the product or the creator has an amazing story and sometimes the product is simply beautiful and I want the world to know about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of inspiration?</strong> Books, design and just walking around my city, paying attention to what surrounds me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite subject to write about?</strong> To be honest, I become consumed by whatever I am writing about and at that moment in time it’s my favourite thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> It has forced to me escape from my shell and I am now much more confident about approaching people that I find are interesting and asking to work with them. I’ve realized that everyone has moments of insecurity and most people absolutely love it when you say you’d like to write about them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> All the amazing designers that have reached out to me. I love working with talented, motivated people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I would have taken more time to learn all the technical behind the scenes aspects of running a blog. For me, knowing backend has taken blogging to a whole new level and made it more enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> To really take the time to notice your surroundings. There is so much beauty in this world and so many wonderful things to discover right in your own neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Go for it! Don’t be intimidated by other bloggers - you never really know what kind of person they’ve created online. Also, never apologize or self-deprecate on your site. You own it and you can do whatever you want.</p>\n"

Having a space to share my very own style and fashion advice was something I couldn’t wait to dive into.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started blogging, did you want readers to turn to you for advice and ask What Would Jen Wear?</strong> I did. I’ve had so many people come to me for advice over the last 10-15 years regarding what to wear on any specific occasion, that I thought maybe my opinions could speak to a bigger audience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen since you started blogging?</strong> I would honestly say it’s the friends I have made. Blogging is such a unique way to connect with people that you have a ridiculous amount of things in common with. Living in Dallas, I’ve been so fortunate to meet and become great friends with several bloggers here. And even outside of Dallas County, I’ve formed incredible friendships with girls all over the United States. Having a supportive community of girlfriends like this is amazing and I don’t think anything else exists like it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My personal style is always evolving so it’s hard to put myself into one or two categories. I describe it as an eclectic mix of just about everything. I get dressed based off of my mood or what has inspired me lately. I draw a lot of my inspiration from the fashion icons of the 1960’s and 1970’s (Ali McGraw, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, Britt Ekland) but I’m also very heavily influenced by basic street style. It doesn’t get any better than that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has pregnancy changed your style?</strong> Pregnancy has toned down my style a bit, but it’s also made me embrace my inner hippie. I can’t dress as colorful and crazy as I used to, which I miss, but I have fallen in love with dressing my bump in very comfortable, bohemian styles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does your blog differ from other personal style blogs?</strong> With so many great personal style blogs out there, it’s difficult to really differentiate yourself. With What Would Jen Wear, I really focus on styling outfits that aren’t sprinkled all over other fashion blogs and social platforms, and I try to encourage people to step outside of the box when it comes to dressing up (or down). I’ve also been blessed to be having my first child in May, so What Would Jen Wear has transitioned into the world of maternity bloggers lately.  But one of the biggest differentiators is the constant communication I have with my readers. On my “Ask Jen” page, I encourage people to ask me any kind of styling questions they can dream of and I respond to them via email with fun fashion tips and links to particular stores, items, etc. I love having that back-and-forth conversation with someone who genuinely trusts my opinion. It always makes my day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you choose outfits worthy of posting?</strong> First and foremost, the outfit has to be unique. I see so many blogs out there that look the same. They don’t inspire me or show me a new way to pair something together… they just make me want blue mirror Ray-Ban lenses because… well… everyone is wearing them. And if I’m being honest, I will probably buy blue mirror Ray-Ban lenses soon because all of the bloggers look so cute in them. But, I want my blog to stand out and really give people ideas to help revamp their closet. I know that a lot of girls don’t have the money to buy everything they see on blogs all the time, so if I can put a new outfit together that reminds them of something they already have in their closet or if I can inspire them to step outside of the box and wear something a little different than they normally would, then I’ve succeeded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Sequins, leopard print and a lot of bright colors - all in moderation, of course. I like finding that unique conversation piece and pairing it with something that can take a backseat. I love putting patterns together that normally wouldn’t jive and I love to experiment with color pairings. I was born with an artist’s eye so I’m very picky when it comes to colors, but I think one of my greatest strengths is pairing them together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I will always be J.Crew’s number one fan because I love the preppy look every now and then, but you can also find me at Nordstrom, Zara, and ASOS for those unique or glamorous pieces. I also love stopping by local thrift stores once a month or so to search for one-of-a-kind pieces – especially sequins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long does an average blog post take?</strong> I put a lot of time into my posts. I’m so picky with the photos I share and the content I provide with the photos. I want each post to have something tangible for my readers but I also want the posts to appeal to more than one audience – especially now that I’ve been engulfed in maternity fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for the future of your blog?</strong> After the baby, I plan to kick my blog into high gear. I have a notebook full of that I cannot wait to executive and I have some exciting collaborations in the works. More than anything, I’m really excited to get back into my old wardrobe and share those bright, colorful styles I’ve been missing. I also hope to introduce some baby fashion for the new mom’s out there, because I cannot wait to dress my little peanut. The possibilities are endless and I’m shooting for the stars with What Would Jen Wear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Leopard booties, kimonos, colorful pencil skirts and my collection of sequin jackets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> How important it is to be consistent and to never stop looking for inspirations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a message you would like to convey to your readers? (Besides what to wear, of course!)</strong> Yes! Don’t listen to fashion rules and don’t be afraid to give trends a try. I hear so many people say “I could never pull that off”. Clothing shouldn’t be intimidating – life is one big game of dress up and it should be thoroughly enjoyed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers or blogging mommy’s-to-be?</strong>\n<em>For personal style bloggers…</em>\nStay true to yourself and your passion for fashion and your blog will go far. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so stay strong, dedicated and determined and you will see results. I promise.</p>\n\n<p><em>For mommy’s-to-be…</em>\nDon’t succumb to maternity clothing – aside from basics – unless it’s really, really cute. There are so many great non-maternity options out there that will last you through pregnancy and beyond and they are so much fun to find. But most importantly, have fun dressing a bump, it’s one of the greatest honors in the world.</p>\n"

Sewing and thrifting are among some of the passions she blogs about, giving her personal style a uniquely creative spin. A combination of modern vintage, sophisticated and urban, Natasha’s looks are all about variety. For all things Fashionably Fab, read on about Natasha’s blogging journey.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> Fashionably Fabulous came to fruition in October, 2013. I initially started blogging for my online store but decided to blog on a personal level as a way to document and share my love for fashion through sewing, thrifting and writing about all things fashionably fabulous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you decide on a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?</strong> The design concept for the blog was originally established when my online jewelry store was created. I wanted to keep a cohesive look among the two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you choose your tagline, “Be bold. Be fabulous. Be you!”?</strong> It is a true reflection of who I am and the message that I want to convey to my readers. My fashion choices are certainly bold. There is no secret that I am a risk taker. Fashion is most certainly about dressing up and feeling fabulous all while remaining true to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> I would say that my personal style is a combination of modern vintage, sophisticated chic and urban. You will more than likely see bold colors and prints reflected heavily. It’s my signature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you choose outfits worthy of posting?</strong> I try to keep variety in mind. So when I decide on posting a look, I always keep the previous look in mind. Variety is the spice of life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does knowing how to sew play into your outfit choices?</strong> Yes. Most certainly. I spend a lot to time, money and effort sewing so the clothes that I make are not for practice only. I make them to be worn. Whenever I’m feeling like wearing a one-of-a-kind, I turn to garments that I’ve made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you tend to gravitate toward neutrals or bright hues?</strong> Bright hues most certainly. I have a love affair with bold colors and prints. I think they complement my complexion well. They also play a positive part in my mood and psyche.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does your Tampa, Florida location inspire your looks?</strong> Hmmm. To some degree. Florida in general plays a part. It’s always sunny here for the most part, so nothing compliments sunshine and palm trees like color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I look to fashion magazines and fellow bloggers for style inspiration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Those comfy boyfriend jeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> It has taught me that passion is key. If you are passionate about the topic at hand, it will show and your readership will grow over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> Hearing from my readers that I have inspired them in some shape, form or fashion has been so cool and rewarding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I wouldn’t change anything. It’s been a great ride.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I would like to convey that there is no right or wrong in fashion. Great style isn’t only reserved for those with access to high-end luxury. It’s ultimately about a creative sense that comes from within; while keeping an open mind for inspiration. It can come from some of the most unexpected places.</p>\n"

For some truly comprehensive fashion inspiration, learn more about Samantha and her blogging journey with What Would Kiki Wear.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long ago did you start What Would Kiki Wear?</strong> I started consistently posting personal style photos in May of 2013. Before that, What Would Kiki Wear was a Tumblr blog comprised of fashion photography, outfit inspirations, and editorials. While it worked as a great inspiration board, I realized it would be easier to create the looks I envisioned myself instead of trying to find them online. That is when I decided to share my own styling posts and begin writing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you choose the name for your blog?</strong> If I only knew how many times I would get asked this question when this started… the name came about when my sister and I had the brilliant idea to dye my (at the time) brunette hair blonde. I wasn’t sure if I would like it so we figured temporary color was the obvious answer. One trip to CVS and a box of hair dye later I was yes, still a brunette. Somehow in this process she pretended to be a European hairstylist saying, “Work that blonde hair Kiki.” That’s how What Would Kiki Wear started… from a box of CVS hair dye as ironic as that is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post a lot of personal style. What is your process of choosing outfits?</strong> My personal style posts center around a trend or a specific piece. I always have a vision of what I want the look to be but I usually don’t have all the pieces planned until minutes before the shoot. Fashion should come naturally and should never feel forced so I don’t put too much time into planning outfits. Don’t get me wrong; I do have those days where I’m standing in my completely full walk in closet so frustrated because I have “nothing to wear.” I don’t plan my ootd posts at all because to me that would defeat the purpose. Outfit of the day posts are supposed to convey a level of realism, I want to show my readers what I would wear running around on the weekend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My personal style is classic glamour with a touch of California inspired boho chic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some other subjects that you blog about?</strong> I recently did a beauty post about my favorite eye makeup products, which was something fun and different to blog about. I occasionally write about a great marketing campaign, some of my favorite items and of course a fashion week recap. I always try to add in tips on how to style different pieces. I absolutely love styling people so this is my way to give advice through my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of fashion inspiration?</strong> When I was about ten I started going through fashion magazines and tearing out ad campaigns and editorials that I liked. I saved them all in a binder that was overflowing with different magazine pages. Eventually the paper pages turned into webpages and my binder upgraded to Pinterest and Tumblr. To this day most of my inspiration comes from fashion editorials and ad campaigns. They are over the top enough that you can find ways to tone it down and make it your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with standout accessories, or bold pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> It depends on the look you’re going for! Basics with standout accessories is definitely a minimalistic chic, less is more look. When I want the clothes to speak for themselves, I break out the bold pieces with my classic jewelry. For me, it’s a balance between the two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your most-loved color or texture combinations?</strong> There’s nothing I love more a fabulous fur statement jacket. I also love a little leopard here and there. These are both things that can be a recipe for disaster but perfection when done right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which pieces do you find yourself wearing over and over?</strong> I’m really into classic handbags. Right now you’ll see me carrying my black quilted Chanel but if not that, it’s my Louis Vuitton Speedy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you gravitate more toward neutrals or bright hues?</strong> It changes with my mood! If I wear a bright bottom, I usually pair it with a black or more subdued top. I guess you could say I’m a combination of the two but very rarely will you see me in bright hues from head to toe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends are you excited to try this spring?</strong> I am so excited for pleated skirts, crop tops (done right) and mules! It’s such a refreshing feel. I’m looking forward to a more feminine and flirty look this spring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I try to shop around and buy items from a variety of places but I do have a few favorites. Alice+Olivia is great for the perfect mix of classic and trendy. The sizes run small and you know you’re getting high quality pieces. Juicy Couture has a lot of items that fit me without alterations, which is always convenient for last minute shopping. You can’t really go wrong with Nordstrom, Neimans, and Barneys. Boutiques are great for more unique pieces that you don’t want everyone else to have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you think your blog stands out from other fashion blogs?</strong> I try not to compare myself to other fashion blogs. I define my personal style by what I’m feeling inspired by that day. I did my “rock and roll” post in denim cut offs, and a leather jacket and the week before I was shooting in a white lace sundress and an oversized navy sunhat. I definitely have a wide range of looks but I try not to make my blog just about me. I want my readers to apply what I’m conveying to their personal style and make it their own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I want to come across as someone my readers feel comfortable reaching out to for styling advice. I hope to give people fashion and styling tips that help them feel more confident about themselves. I always stress that a style that looks good on someone else may not be the style that looks best on you and vice versa. It is so important to figure out what works best for you and not compare yourself to how it looks on someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion and personal style bloggers?</strong> You probably want to start a fashion blog because it’s what you love. Regardless if you have one reader or one million readers, it is so important to stay true to yourself and never lose sight of the reason you started a blog in the first place.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Taylor Morgan</strong> is all about sharing what she loves through <strong>Taylor Morgan Design</strong>. From personal style to home decor, she is passionate about it all. She has worked as a bridal designer and now designs for Tommy Hilfiger, but is determined to make her own brand work. Keep Taylor on your new designer radar, and learn more about her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I have been blogging since the end of 2009. I started so that I could share my journey of going after my dream to start my brand Taylor Morgan. I wanted to share the ups and the downs to show the reality of making your dreams come true. And by doing so, I hoped that I would also inspire others to go after their own dreams, whatever they may be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you decide what you wanted to post about?</strong> I just post what makes sense for me at the time. In the beginning it was a lot about my bridal line I use to do. Now I have moved on from bridal and am working as a designer at Tommy Hilfiger. Now I like to share things I love, whether it is my own street style, home decor I love, or this great city I call home! At the end of the day, this blog is my journey or journal if you will. The end goal is to launch my brand Taylor Morgan and I want people to see my journey to getting there. Every once in a while I throw in a little about my work life. Unfortunately I can’t share to much about what I do at Tommy. But I still like to remind my readers that I do work as a fashion designer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Classic. I love feminine dresses and skirts. Very ladylike. But I also have a casual side to me. I am not big on following trends, I just do my own thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has living in NYC shaped your style at all?</strong> 100%! I feel like NYC helped give me style! There is something about living here that inspires you. There is such a good energy here and some of the best dressed people live here and that all rubs off on you in a good way!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop in the city?</strong> I wish I could tell you that I go to unique one of a kind boutiques. But I don’t. I am just like any other girl who loves Madewell, Zara and J.Crew.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> I love so many designers for so many different reasons. But at the top of my list is Valentino. I love him for not only his work but who he is as a person. He is amazing! All designers inspire me because they have made their brands happen. And I plan to do the same!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Street style. I love just what I see on the streets day to day in the city. And also online from other bloggers. I like street style the most because it’s the reality of what people are actually wearing. I like to take that and work backwards into designing. I feel it helps you be a better designer cause you are truly designing for the everyday person, not just a magazine shoot or runway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Black skinny jeans and a good chambray button up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your go-to colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Black and white are always my go to colors. I love plaids and leopard for patterns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a certain piece or look that feels very you?</strong> Anything black and white! Feminine dresses feel very “me.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It depends on what kind of blog post it is. But I would say about an hour on average.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos or do you have help?</strong> My sweet husband James takes all my photos for me. I edit them myself on my computer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What have you learned through starting and maintaining a blog?</strong> It is a lot of work! It truly could be a full time job when done right. It takes a lot of patience and consistency. But it is very rewarding! You meet lots of great people and companies through it. And it is a great creative outlet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over again, would you change anything?</strong> Sure I would. But it is what it is. You get better as you go. There are lots of old post I look at and cringe, but it’s where I was at at that time. I am sure I will feel the same about my current content in five years. But that’s part of the deal! At least its honest and real. So you can’t ever regret that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> Be yourself and don’t get caught up in the blogging world. Blogging is great! But there is a side of it where you see lots of “fashion bloggers” blogging to become “famous bloggers.” Sure they can have success, but the content doesn’t feel genuine. People connect most to reality. So, just be who you are and don’t try to change yourself or wardrobe for your blog. I relate more to the blogger who shops at Forever 21 than the one with a Celine bag, Louboutin shoes and a $600+ outfit on. That’s not reality for most people. People love real people, so just be you!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Sandee Joseph</strong> of <strong>CurvEnvy</strong> has created a haven where fashion is not just for the skinny. As a style blogger, DIY enthusiast, and expert thrifter, she is ready to share her carefully curated wardrobe with the world. With a background in fashion public relations, having worked with designers such as Norma Kamali and Badgley Mischka, Sandee’s knowledge comes from a fashionable place. Learn more about her and her blogging journey through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why was it important to create a place “where style is not just for the skinny”?</strong> I come from a fashion public relations background having worked for designers like Norma Kamali, Badgley Mischka and the like. While there, co-workers seemed surprised on how “stylish” I was considering I was plus size. I just thought it was prosperous to think that because my dress size is double digits that would mean that I have less style than my slimmer colleagues. Hence, my motto “style is not just for the skinny” was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started CurvEnvy, what did you have in mind?</strong> I initially began CurvEnvy as an extension of my YoutTube channel. My subscribers suggested time and time again to start a blog as a way of getting more fashion tips out to them on a more consistence basis. For those unaware, editing and uploading videos is quite time consuming. At that time, I didn’t even know what a blog was. I took a year or so researching and thinking of a name and on March 3rd 2011, CurvEnvy.com was created.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> I started CurvEnvy three years ago this month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you choose a name, color scheme and graphics for your blog?</strong> I knew I wanted the word curves in the blog name and brainstormed for months. I have a borderline obsession for 50s women fashion which, to me, was the epitome of womanly curves thanks to braziers, and girdles. One night, while watching Mad Men, I remember telling my cousin something like, “how can any woman not be envious of those curves.” My cousin replied “I sure have curves envy.” Eureka! In terms of the color scheme; I’ve always been fond of the color grey and added pink as the ultimate ode to girl power.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that blogging serves as a creative outlet?</strong> Once I began to really dive into it, I came to realize that blogging fed my soul while my 9-5 (career) paid the bills. Blogging has allowed me to become more open to change and people. I have an underlying need to help people so if my blog can help revive or develop a woman’s confidence, I’ve done my job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How important is social media in your blogging process?</strong> I was quite hesitant to start a twitter and Instagram. It took me a while to do so and now, I can’t imagine blogging without it. This mode of communication has allowed me to have a more personal one on one relationship with my readers. They’re able to bounce questions off me and I can hear their needs and wants directly. Not to mention, I’ve gained readers and found other bloggers whose style I admire thanks to social networking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style?</strong> My style is classic and uberfeminine with a dash of trend and a sprinkle of vintage. I love the juxtaposition of hard and soft plus adding an unexpected throwback element. My style is almost like writing an essay: Makeup and hair are the introduction, my wardrobe is the body and my shoes are the conclusion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Lately, Ive been loving pink and neutrals. However, my wardrobe is a color wheel. In reality, my favorite color is white. There’s just something clean cut and crisp about that shade in everything from blouse to slacks. As much as I love color, I love patterns. My favorite has got to be cheetah print. A close second, geometric shapes and polka dots.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> I can’t live without my Spanx, which for me, is a building block for a solid foundation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which outfits are worthy of posting?</strong> The majority of my outfit posts are shot during my lunch break at work. My selections depend on how Im feeling that day. You know the saying ‘life is a stage’? Well, I like to think of my wardrobe as the costume closet. I can change my ‘character’ with each ensemble-it’s just a matter of who I want to be on that given morning. Sometimes I want to be trendy and dress accordingly, other times I want to look professional and handful of times, super feminine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> I’m totally a basics with bold accessories type of girl. Nothing like a plain t-shirt and awesome statement necklace for an understated yet chic look!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore other aspects of the industry?</strong> I attended private school my whole life clad in plaid uniforms so my fashion interest didn’t really surface until college. So much so that, I decided to dive into fashion public relations. I’ve done some live on-air tv work as a model. I would like to eventually headline style segments as a stylist on morning tv. I would love to write a column for a magazine or become an online fashion editor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for your blog’s future?</strong> I am open to how far CurvEnvy can go. I’m in the process of designing t=shirts hopefully to launch this summer. I also want to continue collaborations with brands I love and actually wear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Besides style not being limited to size, I want my readers to see that being a mother, having a full time job, going to school, etc, should not hinder you from stepping out your home looking your best. I intend to defy the preconceived notion that a plus size body cannot be on-trend and/or stylish. In the end, I don’t want a woman’s size to discourage them from knowing and believing that they’re beautiful. They should not look at a smaller woman in envy but as inspiration to make everyone curves envious.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for the aspiring curvy girl bloggers out there?</strong> Advice I’d give is to not jump into blogging before you really sit down and write your plan. Find out your niche, reach out to current bloggers for advice, research, map it out before launching that blog. Also, remember to stay true to yourself and don’t go broke trying to impress. Style doesn’t have to cost a million bucks but you should feel that way in your look.</p>\n"

At home in her Florida beach town, she throws on sundresses in bright, cheerful colors. Going to school in Alabama has introduced her to more layered looks. See both sides of Chandler and learn more about her blogging journey through her Blogspotter interview.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I started my blog “Shotguns &amp; Seashells” a year ago, but not until this January is when I really began to progress with it. I’ve wanted to blog for a long time, but I didn’t know how to approach it. I kind of just ended up going for it and had a big push from a teacher who encouraged and intimidated me to do it all at the same time. Fashion is one of my passions along with being an equestrian; I first chased my dream of being an equestrian, so now it was time to chase my dream of being a fashion blogger. I have had a lot of great support so far, which has helped me grow and mature as a fashion blogger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I knew that I wanted to incorporate the two places I call home, Florida, where I grew up and Alabama, where I go to college. Florida was my inspiration for seashells, while Alabama has been my inspiration for shotguns. In my free time I enjoy going to the beach and embracing the gorgeous Florida weather, but I also enjoying hunting and embracing nature here in Alabama! I grew up in a hunting family, so to me shooting guns and hunting is normal - it was a win/win situation. I felt like Shotguns &amp; Seashells was the perfect combination for representing and describing my country-beach girl style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post mainly personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> Honestly, my style is very distinctive; I have always enjoyed staying up with the trends and I am not afraid to try new things that are out of my comfort zone. I’m always the one who wants to be the first to try the new the trends that are out. If I had to describe my style I’d say it’s a very country-beach girl style. I have also always been the girl to walk around town with jeans and cowboy boots on because that is also who I am. I grew up showing horses competitively, riding daily and being gone almost every other weekend at a horse show. Cowboy boots and jeans have always been a staple in my closet if I wasn’t in my private school uniform, until college came around. Not being able to express my style much growing up made me appreciate it even more now that I can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has going to school in the south changed your style at all?</strong> Going to the south has really changed my style, especially when it gets cold. In Florida, during the winter, I can still get away with white jeans or running around in a bikini and a sundress. In the south I have invested in lot of sweaters, coats and dark colors; however, I always try to sneak in some brightness to remind me of Florida. Also, being in the south there is a different style. Sure it seems similar, but I still didn’t want to dress like my everyday beach town. I always wanted to try something knew, but still always wanted to be who I am. Living in Alabama has enhanced my style and made me try new trends; it has opened me up to a whole new world. My style has definitely matured since moving to Alabama and going to college, it’s been a good change for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Let’s get real now - I love to shop anywhere and everywhere. To be honest, I don’t have any specific favorites, I love going to new places and seeing the local boutiques and supporting their businesses. I was raised to support local businesses, but don’t get me wrong, I am also a department store gal because they offer just about everything. Growing up in a small town, I shopped at Sassy Boutique because it was always up to date on all trends and carried my favorite designers! My other local favorite is Lazy Daisy, a Lilly Pulitzer store, in Vero Beach. Now in Tuscaloosa I do a lot of online shopping just to get a little box on my doorstep, but I also love their local boutiques too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> Susana Monaco will ALWAYS be one of my favorite designers; she has classic pieces to dress up or down that seem to fit just right. You also don’t see her in many Alabama boutiques, so it’s fun to have items that others don’t have! Lilly Pulitzer is a huge style icon to me; her timeless prints remind me of old Florida and they are so colorful - I absolutely love her! Another favorite is Kate Spade; all of her whimsical and bright accessories, shoes and purses just make me smile. Recent favorites would include Alice &amp; Trixie, Clover Canyon, and always JCrew.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I mostly owe much of my style to my mom and what I saw her wearing as I grew up, as well as what she wears today. She’s a huge fashionista, just like I am, and we love to share style advice. I’m also obsessed with Rachel Parcell’s of the blog Pink Peonies. She is an inspiration to me; I aspire to be like her! I’m also a huge Pinterest person too, I love to look around and get style inspiration from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which outfits are worthy of posting?</strong> When I pick my outfits I try to do something that not only I like, but also my followers will like. I love giving out fashion advice to people and I try to pick something people will follow along with. I also like to choose outfits that I feel confident in, especially when they’re coming from my closet. Picking out outfits that are by season, trending and must haves are something I really focus on. I always try to do a monthly trend and a must have. I want to keep my followers up to date and wanting to come back to look at more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> A typical post could take me anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 days. I easily get sidetracked and I am always just over analyzing everything to the very last detail</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own pictures, or do you have help?</strong> I have a sorority sister and good friend, who is an interior design major and aspiring amateur photographer, she loves to take my pictures and I love having the help. Charlotte Fleishel captures all of the photos of me that you see on my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> It has been a huge learning experience for me, but I have gotten a lot of feedback from friends and family, which has made me feel confident about my blog. When I first started out I thought I was going to excel quickly, high hopes and wishful thinking, but I quickly realized it’s a bigger time commitment and it takes a lot to run a blog. I know it’s been worthwhile for me and I can only imagine what Shotguns &amp; Seashells is going to be like later down the road.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you’ve started?</strong> Having people contact me about wanting to collaborate or feature an item on my blog has been really exciting and a big step for me. Also, having great friends along the way that teach me blogging techniques, help take great pictures, and design cute logos – this has made my life so much easier and allowed me to keep all of my attention on the fashion. Trina Turk liked one of my photos on Instagram, so that was a big deal. Also, Carley of Bourbon &amp; Boweties reposted a photograph I had of my wrist filled with her bangles on Instagram. The thing that was so special to me was that my horse was in the photograph and she posted it for millions to see, which was huge to me - that horse is my life!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> That time management is EXTREMELY important and something I need to work on more. Maintaining a blog is not easy, but I try my hardest to do it. There are things I’m constantly trying to improve on and it makes my life hectic. If my life wasn’t hectic I’d be bored out of my mind. I juggle my blog, I’m an active member of Zeta Tau Alpha and their t-shirt chair, schoolwork, and my friends and family. It’s not easy, but I’m determined and I’m taking it one step at time, it’s who I am. I live a hectic life and that’s because I chose to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message do you want readers to take away from Shotguns and Seashells?</strong> It’s that you can do whatever you want. I am young, just 21 years old, and starting out my life. Blogging is something that I’ve always wanted to do and I did it. It doesn’t matter what you do or what your style is either, because one day I’m Shotguns or one day I’m Seashells, or some days I’m both. Not everyone is put together on a daily basis and you shouldn’t have to be. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for advice, I do it all the time and I want people to know to stay true to themselves. I don’t blog about something I’m not - nobody should!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Just go out there and do it. Promote yourself like crazy. Sometimes you can get caught up in the fashion blogger fantasy, but remember who you are and where you came from. Even though I’m the Shotguns &amp; Seashells fashion blogger, I will always be the small beach town girl who will NEVER grow out of horses, EVER. Get out there and let people know who you are and tell them about you so you can be someone else’s inspiration.</p>\n"

She takes inspiration from everywhere, including her fellow bloggers, and is leather pants and dainty jewelry obsessed. She is a firm believer that fashion should be fun, and that’s what blogging is all about! Get to know Alyssa through her Blogspotter questionnaire.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> Less than a year. I have always been in love with fashion and after studying Fashion in Milan I really decided to fine tune my own personal style. Once I got that down I decided to document it and just have fun being myself. I was a huge blog follower before I ever had the time or ideas to start my own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with a name for your blog?</strong> The name for my blog was actually the hardest part about creating my blog. It came to me one day because I decided I wanted to add fitness fashion to my blog concept. I am such a fitness freak but also obsessed with fashion and leather so ‘The Leather Skinny’ fit perfectly. It speaks to the fashion aspect of my blog as well as the fitness aspect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post mostly personal style. Give us a brief description of yours.</strong> My personal style is relatively simple. I love anything leather and usually have either leather pants or a leather jacket on at any given time. But I also love to play with textures and prints, silk and leather is one of favorites mixes. I also like to keep things clean, never too much jewelry, I prefer to keep the focus on the clothing I am wearing. And I am a shoe HOARDER, it seriously is a problem but I have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> A lot! It’s consistent work and that is the hardest part about it, you have to be on top of every post and even plan weeks in advance for future posts. It is very interesting. In fact, when I started my blog is was going to be just for fun and really at my own leisure (almost a way to document my awesome outfit ideas for use later!) but then I got such amazing feedback and found that my very small following of people really were waiting for my next outfit post because it then inspired them! That is the most incredible part about blogging, you really do reach more people than you can even imagine and it is so much fun to know that you helped someone come up with an outfit for that night out or whatever occasion!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite prints to wear?</strong> I love star prints and some edgier floral prints.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your go-to places to shop and why?</strong> Aritzia, because they have the best basics, Revolve Clothing because they carry unique brands that you can’t find anywhere else and Shopbop because they simply have everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I get inspiration everywhere, from someone walking on the street to magazines. Most often, though, I get inspiration from my fellow bloggers! I love to browse some of my favorite blogs and pull ideas and inspiration directly from them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> All of my leather pants and every single one of my Equipment silk blouses. Obsessed with both. I swear I will be buried in leather pants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> I actually prefer basics with dainty jewelry 90% of the time. Occasionally I will add a statement necklace or statement earrings but I love dainty gold jewelry I just think it is so classic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name some of your style icons.</strong> Nicole Richie POST babies, she is un-real when it comes to cutting edge fashion and taking risks. I love that about her. Never do I see a picture of her and think ‘Oh man I would never wear that’, it just never happens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It really depends on what the post is about. If it is just an outfit then it is very quick and easy especially if I already have the pictures! If it is more of a wordy post then it takes a bit longer because I become OCD about grammar, spelling and all that jazz. But ultimately my blog is just me posting what I feel at that particular moement and so it never takes too long.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photographs, or do you have help?</strong> My loving, wonderful boyfriend gets dragged along with me to take my pictures! He actually has a really unique and artsy eye that helps when coming up with locations and poses! One of the many, many reasons I love him to death!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neutrals or bold hues?</strong> Neutrals, hands down. Neutrals worn right are bold in themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Just have fun with fashion! It is supposed to be unique and self-inspired and reflect who YOU are as a person. I have definitely had my moments where I may have ended up in US Weekly’s ‘What NOT To Wear’, but that is what makes fashion so fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> Definitely be yourself. I can’t tell you how many times I have come across blogs that seem forced and unnatural. And readers see right through that! No one is perfect and that is what makes a reader connect with your blog!</p>\n"

She believes that fashion and beauty go hand in hand, and that a look is not complete without the perfect lip. We couldn’t agree more! Learn more about Suma’s views and her journey as <strong>The Fashion Beauty Junkie</strong>.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I have been blogging for a little over two years! Crazy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I actually had a really hard time coming up with a name in the beginning. I knew I wanted to compile or combine words that I felt was going to describe my blog exactly. After a few combination flops, I finally came up with The Fashion Beauty Junkie, which I am now referred to by the people in my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would describe my personal style as Rocker Gypsy Chic. I love all the elements of being girly but I like to do it with an edge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Both! I love pairing simple pieces like a plain white tee with a statement necklace but I also love simplicity when it comes to my accessories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Since I live in NYC, we have amazing Thrift Shops and those are always my go to when I want to mix up my closet for cheap. I also love all the new independent designers I have found through social media!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> I have stuck to the same designers for years and they constantly inspire me and I always want to buy everything in their line. Alexander Wang and Marc Jacobs are my top two. They stay true to who they are and the average girl can feel comfortable wearing their brand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> This is a pretty hard question because, I am inspired by so many things! So with that being said- I’m going to have to say the environment inspires my style!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post about fashion and beauty. What made you decide on these topics?</strong> Well, it’s pretty simple. Fashion and beauty go hand in hand in my book. When I pick out something to wear, I know my look wouldn’t be complete without the right lip color. I love that I can offer more than an outfit to my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It takes me about 2 days to complete a blog post. One day to write it and one day to edit and revise anything. I feel my brain has a whole new view of the post the next day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own pictures, or do you have help?</strong> My lovely boyfriend Danny is responsible for most of my fashion related photos and I shoot my own beauty related photos. I sometimes have opportunities to work with talented photographers, which I never turn down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> Blogging has been an amazing experience for me. I have loved every single moment of it. I really didn’t think anything would come of it, but every time an opportunity comes my way because of my blog, I know it has been totally worth it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you’ve started?</strong> The coolest thing? That’s a tough one. Can I say meeting Lil’ Jon?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> It has taught me that there’s no such thing as free time. As a blogger, you are constantly working and you have to be a 100% in it to make it! Your readers know and can see the time you put into your blog, so there’s no slacking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message do you want readers to take away from The Fashion Beauty Junkie?</strong> The main message I want my readers to take away from TFBJ is that life is fun and it’s totally ok to be different. I know that sounds a little cliché but I truly do mean that. I don’t try to be something I am not, and I want my readers to see that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion and beauty bloggers?</strong> Stay true to who you are, no one likes a fake. People can see if something isn’t your own. Find your voice and go with it!</p>\n"

Named for her home and sweet baby daughter, the blog features both fashion and design, as well as tidbits from her life in LA. She features her ever-changing personal style, from elegant to tomboy chic to functional pieces meant for keeping up with her little one. Take a peek at Chelsey’s multifaceted life and learn more about her blogging journey.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>When you started West Coast Capri, what did you have in mind? Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea?</strong> When I started, it was much more about our life in LA with not as much fashion, but then my readers started requesting more fashion and those were the most popular posts so it became much more of a fashion blog then I had originally planned. I think it’s important to adapt to what your readers want so I love where it’s at right now and everything I’m writing about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog features life, fashion, design and inspiration. What made you want to include these categories?</strong> As an interior designer, I have written a blog that was just about design in the past, but I found that I love so many things that I wanted a place to include all of my passions and that includes everything in the fashion world, home décor, traveling, and trying new recipes in the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post a lot of personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong>\nMy style varies from preppy and tom-boy to dressed up and elegant. That’s what I love about fashion so much is that I can try different looks all the time. But most of all, I try to keep the staples of my wardrobe with the classic pieces that last through the years and don’t go in and out with the seasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has your style changed throughout the years? Has it changed since you became a mommy?</strong> My style has become more mature over the years, but since being a mom I think the only thing that has changed is that I go for a lot more comfortable and functional pieces in my closet since I’m chasing a little one around all day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop for you and your daughter?</strong> I am a complete JCrew fanatic and so of course I love crewcuts as well. I also love Zara, Madewell, and Anthropologie just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> I can never have enough chambray shirts. I love every shade of denim and they just go with everything. I could wear one everyday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Basics with bold accessories – my collection of statement necklaces is growing rapidly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> I have always been drawn to floral patterns and stripes - they are definitely my favorites. Especially for this spring, I love all the beautiful florals I’ve seen. Neutral shades of tans and whites have always been a big majority of the colors in my closet, but lately I am wearing lots of blues and more black than usual.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does your interior design work inform your clothing choices, and vice versa?</strong> I definitely think it plays a big part. The color scheme that I am loving for a room design is often colors that I love putting into an outfit. Lighting is one of my favorite accessories in a room because it’s like the jewelry that just adds the perfect eye-candy to your look and I love dressing up an outfit with accessories as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> I have loved writing my blog. I feel like all the hard work is so worth it when you meet wonderful readers who are inspired by your work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> I would have to say that getting to work with amazing brands that I have looked up to and been inspired by their style has been one of my favorite things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Learning the whole blogging industry has been so eye-opening, but also realizing how much hard work goes into every detail of a blog. I’ve loved getting to know so many other bloggers and I’ve realized how important it is to lift one another up and celebrate others successes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> That’s hard to say because some are more work than others, especially planning a party but probably on average it’s 3-4 hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I hope to inspire others to live a more beautiful life through fashion by helping women look and feel their best, as well as creating your home into a space you love and cooking beautiful meals for your family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers interested in fashion and interior design?</strong> My advice would be to find your own voice and what makes you unique because then your strengths will set you apart. I would also recommend that you find resources around you to help with the skills you need to be a successful blogger such as photography, photoshop skills, graphic design, social media expertise, web design, and writing. But most of all I would say to it needs to be something you’re passionate about because there is a lot of work involved, but when you love it then it won’t feel like work.</p>\n"

Lizzy’s look is rooted in basics but is never boring. Topped with trendy oversized coats and chic chapeaus, she navigates her stylish life. We’re lucky to have gotten a peek and will continue to consult Lizzy when it comes to fashion inspiration. You would be wise to do the same, by learning more about her via Blogspotter!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog seems fairly new. What are your plans to develop it further?</strong> I started my blog in January 2014 so it’s still young. I starting blogging here in Vancouver but starting in April I’ll be relocating to Melbourne, Australia. I’m not sure what changes that will bring to Lizzy Maric but I’m excited to find out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start blogging in the first place?</strong> I started blogging back in 2011 with an old blog. It was started at the same time I went to school for fashion merchandising and it’s original purpose was to be more of an “inspiration blog” rather than photos of myself. It took a long time for me to boost up the confidence to post photos of my own outfits but I’m glad I did. Plus I thoroughly enjoy bugging my boyfriend to take pictures of me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long ago did you start?</strong> I started blogging back in 2011 (coldfashioned.net). I only started Lizzy Maric two months ago so it’s still a baby blog!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you plan on keeping your posts personal style based?</strong> Maybe. I have few ideas floating up in my head but haven’t made any decisions yet. Again, my blog is still fairly new but I’m always looking for new opportunities (as long as it does not involve photoshop as my skills are seriously lacking).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My style is ever-changing. I’m inspired by a number of different things and frequently change with my environment. Lately I’ve been more of a minimalist but that may be because I’ve downsized my wardrobe quite a bit (moving and all). Someone once described my style as “grunge meets glamour” but that was with my old blog. I feel like I’ve grown since then - I’ve become a bit more sophisticated with my style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to keep your blog simple and clean, graphics-wise?</strong> I wanted my photos to stand out the most. I’ve always found busy blogs to be distracting and I wanted my readers to focus on my content rather than what surrounds it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you choose to name your blog after you?</strong> I wish I knew the answer! I bounced around a couple names but I kept getting bored with them. It’s pretty hard to get bored with your own name so I stuck with it - plus I had already purchased the domain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you gravitate more toward basics or bold prints?</strong> Usually basic, but I do like to surprise myself with a little print now and them</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neutrals or bright hues?</strong> I used to be all about bright hues - until I had a closet full of baby blue and corals (and colour blocking was on its way out). This past year I’ve stuck with neutrals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your most-loved color or texture combination?</strong> I love working with basic colours (see above).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any interesting posts or categories planned for the future?</strong> I do! You’ll have to wait and see!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult part of getting your blog up and running?</strong> Getting up the courage to post my pictures to the public (I’m shy sometimes).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?</strong> What makes this blog so special to me is that I started writing it for myself. When I used to blog I wrote my posts very clean and was always concerned what people thought of it (I was very self-conscious). Once I started writing in my own voice I noticed my blog had changed (why I switched blogs in the first place). So I guess to answer your question I don’t have a specific message to convey - I just want to (hopefully) provide some inspiration with a bit of entertainment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you so far?</strong> It’s a lot more work than I thought it would be! It’s definitely taught be to stay disciplined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers ready to get started?</strong> Grow a pair and do it.</p>\n"

Kristin takes inspiration from Carrie Bradshaw, while Katey looks to Rachel Zoe, and their personal styles mesh perfectly. They believe that blogging as a team takes work and honesty, but they have pulled it off. Learn more about these stylish ladies and Chronicles of Frivolity with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start Chronicles of Frivolity and how did you choose the name?</strong> We’ve both always been obsessed with both fashion and writing. We talked about starting the blog for a good three years before we actually went through with it. Katey had always hounded me about starting it soon, and then one day when I was studying for a Marketing test and was about to have a mental breakdown, I decided I needed a break from school and texted her saying it was time to brainstorm. The name kind of just came to me… we were throwing out suggestions to each other and it was the first one we had really strong feelings about. It’s the perfect description of what this blog is to us. We’re silly and lighthearted and just want to tell stories about our clothes. Our blog name isn’t serious, because we never take ourselves seriously.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As best friends, do you feel that two heads are better than one when it comes to blogging?</strong> We think it’s the best way to keep our readers interested. Katey is the typical Texas girl – big hair, lots of lipstick, a fan of everything designer. Kristin has a more laidback style and is all about finding the best deals. Our readers can find inspiration from our blog no matter what their own personal style is. It also really helps when one of us goes M.I.A. for a week long vacation or stressful work project because there’s someone there to pick up the slack and make sure we’re posting regularly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How have your skills as PR majors played into your blog?</strong> In school I took an entire class over blogging for my major. Public relations is about knowing your audience and how to reach them most effectively, so instead of thinking to ourselves “what do we want to write about today?” we think “what do our readers want us to write about today?”</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe Chronicles of Frivolity, overall?</strong> Eccentric. We like mixing prints and colors right up to the point where we question if it even looks good together. We tell all of our weird personal stories just to make people laugh. We want our blog to be something people actually read and enjoy, not just something they skim for outfit pictures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of each of your personal styles.</strong> Kristin likes to describe herself as Carrie Bradshaw meets Gwen Stefani. She is always trying to find the perfect mix of ultra girly but still edgy. And since she lives in Austin, there are definitely a lot of bohemian pieces thrown in as well. Katey says she is Rachel Zoe and Olivia Palermo’s love child. She loves a black base, with a girly pattern and plenty of accessories. And every outfit is all about the hair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do your writing and blogging styles differ at all?</strong> We’re both pretty sassy and like to write in a way that makes people laugh. Katey is definitely more of a natural in front of the camera – it took a few shoots before Kristin could even make a normal face for pictures, much less feel comfortable being the spotlight of 2 posts per week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> In Austin I love fun boutiques like Adelante, Hemline, and Luxe Apothetique. It’s fun to find a place that has an eclectic mix of prices because I find the best outfits are always a high-low mix. As a former Nordstrom intern, the store is definitely my go-to for shoes, bags, and fun event outfits. In Dallas I love Milk and Honey Boutique and in Fort Worth I love Beehive. Both are wonderful stores for unique pieces that don’t cost more than $50. I believe in investing in my accessories, because my clothes are going to get ruined by margarita mix eventually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you each have a “style signature” of sorts?</strong> Katey never leaves the house in less than 5 bracelets, even if she’s going to the gym. Kristin doesn’t own any solids – she’s always mixing prints.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your main sources of style inspiration?</strong> We love other blogs! That is the main reason we created ours. We get such great inspiration from seeing what regular girls wear everyday, and we wanted to be able to share ours with others and get more involved with the style conversation other bloggers are having. There’s nothing more fun than when we get to meet other bloggers and talk about shoes and lipstick for hours on end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen since the two of you started blogging?</strong> A lot of cool event opportunities have opened up to us. We like to be around fashion and other people that want to talk about fashion as much as possible. Our blog was featured in the Glitter Guide through one of the events we attended, which was definitely an awesome boost. And it’s always funny to run into someone that recognizes you through your blog. It happens at the worst times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught each of you?</strong> It’s definitely made us more entrepreneurial. After seeing how quickly we could reach success, it’s made us both strive to make the blog more of a full-time project. We have a few side projects we’ll be starting at the beginning of April under our blog that we’re really excited about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you recommend buddying up to start a blog?</strong> It’s like being a roommate with your best friend. About 2% of the population can do it without killing each other. Thankfully, we are the 2%. We have similar enough style (both in our clothing choices and writing) that it makes our blog cohesive no matter who is posting. We have also found our own little niches within the blog as well. For example, Katey handles social media and I handle logistics. Of course there’s some overlap in these areas, but it keeps us from butting heads. You also need to make sure you pair with someone you don’t mind calling out. I have to tell Katey at least once a month “stop posting giveaways so close to each other, you’re going to run out of money” and Katey has to remind me to stop frolicking on the beach because we have deadlines.</p>\n"

Even through her busy life, she keeps us updated on what makeup products to try and what looks she’s loving. Her pretty little ones occasionally make an appearance, adding an extra pinch of delight to her posts. “A cup of beauty with a sprinkle of fashion,” <strong>Fashion Maven… Mommy</strong> is likely to become your latest obsession.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about Fashion Maven Mommy!</strong> Fashion Maven Mommy is a collection of all things beauty and fashion that I’ve personally fallen in love with. I made a conscious decision early on to keep my blog positive… you will not find any negativity here! If I’ve tried it and loved it, I enjoy sharing it with my readers! It is best described as a cup of beauty with a sprinkle of fashion!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you begin blogging, and what was it that gave you the inspiration and idea for Fashion Maven Mommy?</strong> I embarked on this pretty little journey, Fashion Maven Mommy in December 2011. After years and years of searching for a creative outlet, it finally occurred to me… I could blog! From that very moment, everything changed. I felt as though I could finally exhale! This was a new chapter and I couldn’t wait to see where this wonderful road would take me! Initially, I thought this was going to be a fashion blog (hence the name), however, my love for beauty really took center stage and so I just went with it. I guess you can say I’m an accidental beauty blogger!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You were a finalist in Allure’s Beauty Blogger of the Year Awards - how exciting! How did you get involved with the competition, and what did you learn from it?</strong> About two months into blogging, while searching for a way to take my blog to the next level, I came across a double page spread in Allure Magazine. It was as though the universe spoke to me directly. And if the universe speaks… you listen right?! I could hardly believe it when I got the call that I was selected as an alternate! Yes, an alternate… this was the first time around! I literally spent the entire year perfecting my blog with a single mission… to make it to the actual contest the following year! I entered again and I could barely contain my excitement when I got the call from Allure telling me that they totally remembered my blog and loved it. And just like that… I was officially one of the 10 finalists! Best. Day. Ever!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a beauty blogger and a mother - how do you find time to balance it all? Do you set a personal schedule or weekly goals to keep everything up-to-date?</strong> It’s definitely a challenge juggling it all. I take my ‘mommy duties’ very seriously! However, I whole heartedly believe that when you are passionate about something, you just make the time. After tucking my girls to bed, I officially switch to FMM mode. It’s exhausting, yes, but so rewarding! I do keep a journal of ideas and posts that I need to complete. However, when I begin to feel pressure to complete a post I try and remind myself that this is not my job. I never want it to feel like a job! This is my passion and I much prefer to write from the heart. So if one week I complete two posts and another week I complete five, that’s OK!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite beauty brand?</strong> OMG do I have to pick just one?! I have soooooo many that I love equally… Stila, NARS, MAC, Urban Decay, Benefit… the list goes on and on!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Straight hair or waves?</strong> Both!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only have one beauty product in your arsenal - what would it be, and why?</strong> It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye is pretty much the holy grail of concealers! And let’s face it, as a mommy of twins, I’m often sleep deprived! This baby continuously saves my life!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liquid eyeliner or pencil eyeliner?</strong> My current obsession is a great liquid liner pen! I love a fierce cat eye… meow!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makeup artists do you look to for inspiration?</strong> I’m a huge fan of Sarah Lucero of Stila! I’ve recreated many looks inspired by her work on my blog. She’s just such a talent, and while I don’t know her personally, I feel like she must be the most amazing person. I’d love to meet her some day. Most recently, I became obsessed with the gorgeous looks she created for the Alice and Olivia show during Fall 2014 NYFW. Major blog inspiration right there!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Twitter or Pinterest?</strong> Both! They’re so different! Twitter is a great place to share a thought or two. Pinterest is a place of inspiration, organization and major distraction! I spend way too much time pinning all kinds of wonderful things that I will never do! But still… it’s there just in case!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging?</strong> Hands down, being a finalist in Allure’s BBA! That was such a major moment for me! I mean… hello! Allure = beauty bible!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk about social media: do you find that social media has been vital to the success of Fashion Maven Mommy?</strong> Absolutely, social media is a beautiful thing! I’ve met some wonderful friends, amazing bloggers and I can’t wait to meet more! Instagram is my current fave! I just love the instant gratification factor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> Blogging has taught me to believe in myself and in my dreams! Who would have thought when I began this little journey of mine that Allure Magazine would take notice! It just goes to show… if you have a passion for something, pursue it! If it comes from the heart… then it’s right!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be, and why?</strong> Believe in yourself and blog from the heart! Stay true to yourself and what you love to do. I know it sounds cliché but truthfully, your heart will never steer your wrong! Well, maybe a few times in High School but you know what I mean!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>Like many personal style bloggers, she inspires through her outfit choices. But <strong>Shannon Rice</strong> of **Clothes and Quotes **takes it one step further by adding some encouraging words as well. Her aim is to tell you how she feels while skipping the dramatic details. Her notebook of wisdom comes in handy, as she includes a quote with each post. Get a dose of knowledge with your fashion and learn more about Clothes and Quotes through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I was on the phone with my mom one day and we were talking about Pinterest and she mentioned how the majority of my pins are just “clothes and quotes”. As soon as she said it I knew it was perfect because it kind of embodied what I wanted my blog to be about at the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to include a quote with each of your personal style posts?</strong> I’ve kept a notebook of quotes I loved for the past 10 years on top of all the quotes I’ve written in my journals through the years and I always wondered what I could possibly do with them all. So when I started my blog I thought it was a good idea to put a little focus on my love for quotes by ending each post with one. I try to find one that either relates to my post or to my mood when I write the post. It’s kind of a way to tell the readers I how I’m feeling each day without going into dramatic details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I originally started blogging in 2012, but I just wasn’t committed. I knew it was something I wanted to do, but I wasn’t putting the effort in and I wasn’t proud of what I had developed. So I took a break, finished school and decided to start all over. I started Clothes &amp; Quotes in May of 2013.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that blogging has been a worthwhile endeavor so far?</strong> I do, if not just for the personal accomplishment of putting myself out there. I’m proud that I’ve been able to stick with it because I really do enjoy it. I think it will pay off in the long run and I’m excited to learn more about blogging and myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Casual. I’m a total jeans and blouse kind of girl, always with heels and if I’m able to throw on a leather jacket, I’m definitely going to do so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which outfits are post-worthy?</strong> Oh gosh, I don’t even know if the outfits I post are post-worthy! In the beginning I was trying to put together outfits that I thought were post-worthy, but it got tiring and wasn’t the point of Clothes &amp; Quotes. I realized the whole point of this blog is to showcase my personal style, not to showcase what I think others want to see or what others were wearing. I still question most outfits because, like I said, I dress very casual, but at the end of the day that is what I like to wear and that is what I’m most comfortable in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find style inspiration and your encouraging quotes?</strong> Pinterest, always Pinterest. I have a book full of quotes I’ve collected over the years that came from books and articles I’ve read, songs I’ve loved and just ones I’ve randomly came across, but these days it’s all Pinterest. I kind of wish it wasn’t, but it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has your personal style changed at all through the years?</strong> I haven’t been blogging long enough to visually see how my style has changed, but it is one of the things I’m excited to have documented. My style has always been pretty casual, but I now work in an office so over the past few years I’ve really had to add a bit of a more “dressed-up” feel to my casual sense of style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your closet could you never replace?</strong> I don’t think there is anything that could not be replaced. I’m definitely not a sentimental person when it comes it clothes, but the one item I could never not have is a leather jacket. One day I hope to have a budget that allows me to invest in a really nice leather jacket which I can totally imagine will be irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your most-loved color and texture combinations?</strong> I love an all-black ensemble. It just never gets old and can be worn on most occasions. Texture wise I’m going to have to go with leather and lace. I love the contrast of the tough leather mixed with the feminine lace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> The coolest thing that has happened to me since blogging I think it finding my sense of creativity and craving inspiration. I never thought of myself as a creative person, but since I started blogging and constantly looking at other blogs it definitely gets my creative juices flowing and that really excites me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You have always loved writing and fashion. Are you interested in any other aspects of the industry?</strong> Yes, I have always loved fashion and writing. Writing prior to fashion, but the two of them together is just kind of ideal. I’d love to be involved in any aspect of the industry that would allow me to indulge in both of my passions. It would obviously be an ideal scenario.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any future plans for your blog?</strong> At this point, I just really want to focus on building my blog to something that fully represents me and something that I am proud of. Of course I have big dreams of what can come of it, but I’m trying not to get ahead of myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in the lives/style of other bloggers. I mean these girls have serious style and it’s hard not to compare, but I want my readers to feel comfortable just being themselves. I hope they can look at my pictures and my style and see that it is nothing fancy, but it’s me. I hope they can see that as long as they are comfortable in what they are wearing and they feel confident then that is all that matters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion writers/personal style bloggers?</strong> Definitely do it! It really is hard work, but there are so many great people to meet and amazing opportunities to be had that all the work will be worth it. And of course, be yourself! As long as you are true, people will follow and support you!</p>\n"

Educated at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, she has held many positions in the industry that she is so passionate about. She believes that personal style plays a large role in being your personal best and we agree!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Because your blog is fashion and style from a 40+ perspective, do you feel that you have more knowledge and experience under your fabulous belt?</strong> I don’t feel I have more experience in blogging since I just began in June 2013. I do, however, believe that I bring a bit more knowledge to the table about the fashion industry as a whole. With many bloggers, it is about the clothes. Don’t get me wrong, I love clothing, but So What to Twenty is more about personal style and the important role it plays in being your personal best.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Besides the above, what else makes you different from other fashion bloggers?</strong> My educational experience from the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising has played a very important role in my love for the industry. I graduated from FIDM in 1986 with a degree in Marketing &amp; Merchandising. In addition, I have worked in many aspects of the fashion industry from personal stylist to a Fashion &amp; Style columnist for a weekly newspaper.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start blogging in the first place?</strong> I began as a way to release tension from a very stressful situation I was in. I find writing and writing about style very therapeutic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was it difficult to get your blog up and running?</strong> No, it wasn’t difficult to launch it at all. I have the time to work on it, and a tech-savvy husband.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has been your biggest challenge so far?</strong> My biggest challenge has been gaining the audience. I want the public to trust that I’ll have interesting content.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the sassy name for your blog?</strong> Thank you for asking this question. Well, first of all let me begin by stating that it is in no way a slight to younger women. So What to Twenty is saying… I am still viable, I can still rock a look, I am still beautiful in spite of what society tries to say about women of a certain age… so, So What to Twenty! Understand? It is more of a mantra to women who have been seasoned with time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I thoroughly enjoy shopping at vintage boutiques, as well as non-descript shops that are off the beaten path. Also, I am an eBay fanatic. But for more mainstream shopping, I LOVE the world market, the vintage feel of Anthropologie. I like these places because I don’t have the fear of seeing myself coming and going. I like individuality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never replace?</strong> I have jewelry that I inherited from my mother and maternal grandmother that is irreplaceable and holds such precious memories for me. Also, when I was 17, I fell in love with a pair of chocolate leather riding boots by Marc Alpert of Italy. To earn the money for them, I wrote an essay to my father explaining how I would cherish them forever. I still have them and blogged about them in a post called Equestrian Legacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find style inspiration?</strong> I am greatly influenced by the 1950s era. Actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Kate Hepburn, Grace Kelly and First lady Jackie Onassis influence me. Overall, my mood and temperament, the California lifestyle are all some of my style inspirations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I like to say that I shop for items that have no expiration date. My style is Classic + a touch of Boho + a little quirk. The base of my wardrobe mostly consists of great classic pieces, but I enjoy mixing my classics with bohemian influences and always a touch of quirk. It just makes the look for interesting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers and why?</strong> That is tough to answer because every year such fantastic new designers hit the scene. I’ll have to say that my number ones are: Michael Kors, Carolina Herrera, Tracy Reese, Marni, Ralph Lauren and Chloe. I adore these designers the most because they best fit my personal style that I mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> PATIENCE!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?</strong> Those who follow So What to Twenty will know that I have a true passion for the fashion industry as a whole. I truly hope that this message is being conveyed. I also hope that people take that there is a big difference in BEING IN STYLE verses HAVING STYLE. The latter is what I strive toward. I won’t run out and purchase the latest trends. What I do work toward is creating a perfectly curated wardrobe that is built to fit my style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that your blog is targeted only to women your age, or do you think anyone could benefit from your posts?</strong> No, not at all. I believe that So What to Twenty is for ALL women, regardless of age, for the simple fact, it is not all about fashion and more about style. There is a difference. There is a quote that best sums it up – Fashion fades by style is eternal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers of any age?</strong> I’m not sure I’m in the position to give advice for blogging since I am still finding my way. But ask me anything about style and fashion and I can at least point you in the right direction… {wink}</p>\n"

Skirts and femme details are her go-tos, but her looks are also versatile. She started her blog as a visual log of her outfits, and it’s the perfect place to get some ideas for spring! Learn more about Kayleigh through her interview with Blogspotter!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I’ve had my blog since August of 2013, but I didn’t really start posting until November 2013. I’ve always wanted to work in the fashion industry in New York City and one summer I decided to start blogging after being told that it gives employers something visual to look at other than a resume. I’ve always loved fashion and dressing up, so sharing my style with the world for my future just seemed like such a perfect fit for me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name, color scheme, and graphics for your blog?</strong> I struggled with picking a name for some time. Kayleigh’s Kloset was something that one of my Mom’s friends recommended because I have such a large amount of clothes. Spelling “Kloset” with a K was also perfect because my family has always called me “Kay-Kay” and now my blog’s initials are K.K. I love pink, and that should definitely be apparent whenever you visit my blog! So pink was the only color option for me. My logo is gold glitter because gold is my second favorite color. I was obsessed as soon as I learned how to do it on photoshop!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post mostly personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> I’m very versatile and it mainly depends on my mood. For the most part I’m extremely girly, but I try to make my outfits as glamorous as I possibly can. I’m in college so there can be a preppy feel one day, and I work at Anthropologie so I’ve been adding a lot of Boho-chic elements lately!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has your personal style changed throughout the years?</strong> Oh most definitely. When I was in middle school I would wear whatever I wanted, and that wasn’t always a good thing. I’ve gone through a tomboy phase and the t-shirt/nike shorts phase. I like to think that hopefully I’ll look back on how I dress now and be proud of it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Hmmm that’s a tough one. A year ago I would say basics with bold accessories but now I would say stand out pieces with dainty jewelry! However, I’m all for mixing statement pieces and bold jewelry! It’s always great to see someone being bold and brave with their outfit choices!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> Pink anything! Hot pink, light pink, magenta, radiant orchid, all shades honestly. I also love metallics or a simple black and white contrasting outfit. I’d say my favorite pattern would be floral and I love that it’s back this year! Second favorite would be a cute Aztec print on a kimono, skirt or a crop top.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I love Anthropologie because I get to see all of the news items come in and the quality is fabulous. Nordstrom is my go-to department store. Kate Spade and Henri Bendel are my splurge stores! Lulu’s, Shop Hope’s, Tobi, and Boca Leche are my favorite online stores because of their never-ending new arrivals that are always calling my name! My favorite discount stores are Marshalls, Nordstrom Rack, Kate Spade and Tory Burch Outlets and Saks Off Fifth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My little yellow Chanel purse that my Mom gave me for my eighteenth birthday. It’s probably my most prized possession. I still get nervous whenever I wear it because I don’t want it to get dirty!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there certain looks or pieces that feel very you?</strong> My friends will see a hot pink dress with an open back or a large bow and will send me pictures saying “this dress is so you.” Any dress or skirt that is very girly, flirty and feminine is very “me!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos or does someone help you?</strong> Recently I’ve been a one-man-show which has been interesting. I’ve grown up with a Grandpa who is a professional photographer and he’ll take pictures if I ask him to, he’s the best! But he lives two hours away so I can’t always go to him for every outfit. So lately I’ve been using a self-timer and camera tripod and I’m (slowly) catching on! It took me a few months to realize that my camera wasn’t even a D-SLR and I just had it replaced! The photography side of things is so new and confusing to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> I can usually get a post up fairly quick. Pictures take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes. The writing and linking of a post can take about the same time. I usually plan what I’m going to say in advance whenever I pick out an outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Time management. It’s not easy being a full time student with two jobs and a blog. I’ve learned that pictures are best if they are taken in bulk and ahead of time. I try to take my pictures in the morning before class or on the weekends when I don’t have anything going on. It’s also taught me that anyone can achieve their dreams. I never would’ve thought that my blog would be as successful as it is! It’s a crazy and amazing experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for the future of your blog?</strong> I hope to see it continue to grow. I have quite a few fun collaborations coming up with boutiques and stores. I hope to start doing local collaborations both in Houston and Norman. I’m living in New York City this summer so I can’t wait to being posting around the city! It’s the perfect backdrop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Never give up on your dream because if you work hard enough you can achieve it. My blog slogan is “A girl with big dreams and an even bigger closet,” and in this year alone I have already fulfilled quite a few of my dreams!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers wanting to reveal what’s in their closets?</strong> There’s no time like the present to get started, but make sure you’re prepared! Make a calendar of when you’re going to post what and don’t be afraid to step out of the box! The only thing that should matter is how you feel about your outfits and posts. Be patient with your blog and befriend other bloggers. The blogging community is filled with tons of amazing people who are always willing to help out beginning bloggers!</p>\n"

She’s into standing out in bold hues and fitted silhouettes, citing Kate Spade, Trina Turk, and Lilly Pulitzer as influences. If you’re looking for a dose of fashion and tons of fun, The Fashion Tweaker is definitely the right place.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>First of all, your blog is SO FUN. How do you convey so much vivaciousness in all your posts?</strong> Hahaha! Why thank you! Honestly, it’s not something I try to do, I guess it just happens because that’s who I am. I’ve been told that I have a big, bright, colorful personality and apparently it comes through in my photos!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> My sister and I started a popular cocktail blog called Fashionably Bombed in 2010. After a few years and a good amount of success (we actually have a book coming out in June called “Candy Cocktails”!) we wanted to try starting our own individual blogs. I started Fashion Tweaker in November of 2013 because if I could, I would spend all day, every day, playing in my closet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Whenever I buy something I inevitably end up tweaking it in some way- I’ll change the buttons, make it more fitted, add a belt, raise or lower the hem, etc… so it seemed like the perfect name. Plus there’s the whole double entendre- fashion being my drug of choice!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you choose the color scheme and graphics?</strong> It seems like I always want everything to be bigger, brighter, shinier and more intense! You can often her me saying, “Does it come in a brighter color?” So I thought the hot pink and red stripes outlined in gold glitter did the job…but oh no, that wasn’t enough, I had to add tons of shiny gold curly ribbon to the background!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Bright, colorful &amp; fun! I like pattern and texture and fitted silhouettes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> Kate Spade, J.Crew, Trina Turk, Lilly Pulitzer because, like me, they are not afraid of color!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you always been interested in fashion? Would you like to explore other aspects of the industry?</strong> Yes! Growing up, whenever I complained about not having anything to wear, instead of whisking me off to the mall to go shopping, my mom would say, “Well you better get creative!” Although I HATED when she said that, I think that’s where my love of fashion and my ability to put outfits together comes from. I would spend hours in my closet “getting creative” and I still do! As for the other aspects of the industry, I am open to it all!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> Everything around me! Recently I’ve been inspired by the turquoise and pink floral wallpaper in my bathroom, the leopard hats of former African dictator Mobutu, the architecture of Palm Springs…</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> ALL OF THEM! The brighter the better! You will almost never find me wearing black. I love patterns too! Stripes, polka-dots, plaid, florals, gingham, etc…</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> Blogging has been the perfect way to express my creativity and connect with other creative people. A worthwhile endeavor? Oh hell yes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> I always thought that amazing things happened to people because they got lucky. I imagined that one minute they were sitting on the couch watching TV and the next minute they were popping champagne because they got their own TV show deal! I never knew how much work went into making those things happen. Blogging has taught me that if you are consistent and patient those amazing things will SLOWLY start to come to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It’s hard to say because when I’m working on my blog I’m having so much that I don’t pay attention to the clock! From photo shoots to graphic design, I would say a few hours, at least.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have help taking your photographs, or do you do them yourself?</strong> Because I already had a few years of blogging experience behind me before I started Fashion Tweaker, I knew how important high quality, professional looking photographs were. I hired a professional photographer from the very beginning. It has definitely been a wise investment!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What plans do you have for the future of your blog?</strong> All of them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for bloggers wanting to create a space as bright and welcoming as yours?</strong> Yes! Stop talking, start doing!</p>\n"

I also have some talented photographer friends, like my boy Ricky or my girl Raqeebah who have taken photos for the blog before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide on so many different locations and varying poses?</strong> Usually when I’m about to take photos, I have plans to hang out with friends or whatever after so on the drive to wherever I’m going, we just kinda check out the area and if we see a cool spot we pull over and shoot. As for poses, I just kind of stand there mostly haha.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> Minimal, and a little grungy. I also like to think it’s low-key Parisian chic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find yourself gravitating more toward neutrals or bright, bold hues?</strong> Probably more toward neutrals. If I’m wearing color it’s usually very muted or a pastel shade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are always photographed in sunglasses. Is that kind of your signature?</strong> I guess it kinda became my signature. I live in Florida, so when I’m being photographed it’s usually extremely sunny. It’s always sunny here, even when it’s raining.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide on a corresponding song to go with all of your posts?</strong> Sometimes when we’re shooting, the location will make me think of a song. Other times it’s just a song I’m listening to on loop at that particular time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You also do the occasional beauty-related post. Do you consider yourself somewhat of a beauty connoisseur as well?</strong> I think I’m more of a moisturizing connoisseur. I’m definitely into skincare more than cosmetics, but I do really love a good lipstick. I have an embarrassingly large lipstick collection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who or what is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I think it’s pretty apparent that music is a huge part of my life, and I think it subconsciously inspires my outfits. Like, if I’m listening to Siouxsie and the Banshees when I’m getting ready, you’ll probably catch me in a lot of leather with super strong brows and a red lip. Or if I’m listening to something more mellow like James Blake or Beach House I’ll probably put together more of a monochromatic look. I also really love Emmanuelle Alt’s style, she just always looks so effortless. And Yasmin Sewell is definitely another style inspirations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start blogging to begin with?</strong> I’ve always been into fashion, and I started following a few fashion blogs when I was about 16 or 17. My sisters and friends would ask me all the time why I didn’t have a blog, and I didn’t really have an answer. Once I was done with undergrad I immediately started pursuing my masters degree, after a couple semesters I decided I needed a break to just relax and enjoy life and that’s when I started my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging?</strong> Less than a year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging worked out for you so far? Was it a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> It’s actually really fun, so it’s definitely worthwhile. But shortly after I started my blog I got a job as a counselor, which kind of made blogging a little more difficult because I work five days a week, but whenever I think I have time to shoot a look I make it happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you feel that your blog stands out from others?</strong> Well for starters, I wear a scarf, so that kind of sets me apart. Also, I incorporate music into all of my posts so it’s more of a combination of music and style rather than just the latter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen to you, or best feedback you’ve gotten since you started?</strong> A photographer named Langston Hues reached out to me last year to take my photo for a streetstyle book he’s putting together which was pretty cool. And my favorite menswear blog Four-Pins mentioned me as one of their 20 muses of 2013 which is probably the dopest thing that has ever happened to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you interested in any other areas of fashion?</strong> Menswear. I love taking menswear pieces and making them more feminine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong>\nThat taking photos is really hard. And the sun sets way too early.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Arielle Worona</strong> sincerely relishes the world of fashion. She is inspired by not only how people dress, but also the art behind it. Hence,** RELish by Arielle** was born. She vowed to post a fashion illustration every day and has now branched out into everything from personal style to DIYs. As her blog grows, it only gets better. Learn more about Arielle and her blogging journey through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> Ever since I can remember, I have been completely enamored by fashion. I’ve been fascinated not only by the way people express themselves through clothes, but also by the art of fashion itself. I started blogging about a year-and-a-half ago because I noticed myself becoming more and more addicted to the world of fashion blogging: I would wake progressively earlier each morning just to look at the latest posts on my favorite blogs before work. It soon became clear: I had an addiction. As a Television Executive based in Los Angeles with a very hectic schedule, I dreamed of starting a fashion blog of my own where I could display my own original fashion illustrations and outfit posts but I didn’t think I would be able to find the time. About a year-and-a-half ago, with my fashion blog addiction at its peak, I bit the bullet and started RELish By Arielle so I could challenge myself to post just one new fashion illustration a day. I’d go home after work and start painting; I felt so inspired and it was such a great way to clear my mind and press refresh. Over time, my blog began to morph into D.I.Y. posts, outfit posts and everything in between. Today, I’m so thankful that I started my blog when I did because it has given me a space where I can be 100% creative for at least a few minutes everyday. My ultimate goal is to inspire other bloggers as much as they continue to inspire me. #Slowlybutsurely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with a name for your blog?</strong> Growing up, my younger brother and sister always called me “Relish.” Supposedly, the idea behind this nickname came from the fact that the word “relish” has the letters ‘R,’ ‘E’ and ‘L’ at the beginning, which actually sound like “Arielle” when said together quickly. Likewise, I guess I can thank my fabulous siblings for the initial inspiration behind the name RELish By Arielle. From there, I also love that the word “relish” means to ‘savor’ or greatly ‘enjoy’ something. Every time I post something new on RELish By Arielle, it’s something I love that I also hope my readers will be inspired by.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post mostly personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> I would describe my personal style as classic with a touch of rocker and a dash of boho.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I love shopping at boutique stores and vintage stores because I love finding unique pieces that no one else will have. I am also a huge fan of Zara because the price-point is so affordable but the clothing is so classic with a trendy twist. One of my favorite department stores to shop at is Nordstrom because it’s a one-stop-shop with all my favorite brands in one place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> I am a huge fan of Rodarte because I love that the line is designed by sisters who have such an innovative eye for fashion. Moreover, as a fashion illustrator myself, I’ve always been mesmerized by Oscar De La Renta’s incredible gowns. His gowns are often my greatest inspiration behind my illustrations because they’re timeless and so feminine; if only we could wear gowns all day everyday. Likewise, I also can’t get enough of Chanel. I have an obsession with vintage Chanel and the fact that her pieces will forever remain in style. I also love that she was such a strong woman who wasn’t afraid to defy the odds and change people’s perspectives about how women should dress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> My main source of style inspiration comes from couture fashion illustrations and from other bloggers who are really pushing the envelope. I read tons of blogs everyday before work–including Paper Fashion, Song of Style, Gal Meets Glam, Sea of Shoes and The Blonde Salad. I am so thankful to these ladies for paving the way and continuing to keep their posts so innovative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What spring trends are you excited to try?</strong> I can’t wait to try midi skirts in all different spring colors. I love how lady-like and classic these skirts are—especially when paired with the perfect stiletto. I also have my eye on beautiful pastel pieces right now — from baby pinks and blues to light purples and yellows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> I am really 50/50 on this one—I love dainty jewelry because it’s so versatile. However, whenever I do wear basics, I love pairing them with bold, statement pieces that really dress up the outfit. The trick for me here is not to go too gaudy; I’m all about less is more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite colors and patterns to wear?</strong> As a native New Yorker, I have a ton of black pieces in my wardrobe but now that I live in LA, I’ve tried my very best to give my wardrobe a bright color boost. I am now gravitating towards bright pinks, blues and reds. As far as patterns go, I often lean towards simple and classic looks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos or does someone help you?</strong> I am so lucky to have partnered up with my very talented photographer friend, Alexandra Lee Nurthen who takes the pictures on my blog. We were both in the same sorority back when we were studying at Syracuse University. After graduation, we both found ourselves living in LA and we decided to put our heads together to bring RELish to life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you go about choosing outfits worthy of posting?</strong> I gravitate towards outfits that are true to my style and those that I know will pop on camera—whether they’re really bright in color or they have an interesting texture. I should also mention that many bloggers often feel a need to go out and spend money on new looks so they can post about what is brand new and of the moment. Although I love buying new clothing just as much as any other girl, (if not more - I may or may not have a fashion obsession) I really try to do my best to stick to what I already own for my posts. I find this both fun and challenging, not to mention cost-effective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> An average post can take me anywhere from 30 minutes to well over an hour. I am a perfectionist — I like to make sure the photos I choose are the strongest from that day’s shoot and I also pay close attention to my writing. Although many people head to fashion blogs to scroll through the pictures, I always try to make sure that my descriptions are just as engaging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Starting and maintaining a blog has taught me that there are (almost) no excuses: we can all find some extra time to go after our passions. Likewise, our full-time jobs should not define us or hold us back from exploring other worlds that make us come alive. Thankfully, my position in the television industry continues to inspire me and pushes me to want to learn more. That said, balancing my blog with work has taught me to gain even better time-management skills. These skills are vital to running a successful blog—especially if you are not blogging full-time. I believe it’s best to post at least 5 times a week so that your readers really get to know you and they keep coming back for more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started?</strong> I think the coolest thing that has happened is that people have started to reach out from all over the world to ask me for fashion advice and to see if I they can buy my original fashion illustrations. The power of the internet is crazy! Sometimes I write posts and I can’t believe anyone outside of my family and friends are taking the time to read them. I am so humbled—especially since I have been painting and drawing fashion illustrations my entire life but until I started RELish, I never really put my work out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> My advice to aspiring personal style bloggers is that they shouldn’t wait until tomorrow or next year to start blogging—they should start now. I started reading fashion blogs years ago and if I had started my own blog way back then, I would have found myself as inspired as I am now years ago. I’d also suggest that new bloggers should take some time to hone in on what makes them unique. The market is growing more and more saturated with fashion bloggers so it’s important to ask yourself: how do I stand out? What makes me different? If you’re true to yourself, your blog will be organic and your readers will feel that energy. Lastly, especially when you’re just starting out, it’s important to utilize your network and the people who love you most for help. Your friends and family can most likely help you for free! Maybe your mom is an amazing photographer. Maybe your best friend in school is a social media guru. Look to those in your inner-circle for help and look to experts and those succeeding already for advice and further inspiration.</p>\n"

This is one blog you’ll be visiting nonstop to see the latest. Learn more about Katie and see what the buzz is about with Blogspotter!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve had immense success with your blog, Martinis and Mascara. From Allure Beauty Awards (you were a finalist!) to a soon-to-be column with Giuliana Rancic’s “FabFitFun” - we’re so inspired! Tell us a little bit about Martinis and Mascara.</strong> Thank you so much! Winning the title of Allure’s Most Buzzworthy Blogger has been absolutely amazing and opened up so many doors for me! I’m thrilled to start my column on Giuliana Rancic’s FabFitFun soon too. Martinis and Mascara is a blog devoted to all things beauty (and occasionally, cocktails!) where I feature beauty product news, reviews, and advice – all served to you straight up!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for? I launched Martinis and Mascara in Feb. 2012, but I’ve been writing about beauty for various publications for close to eight years now. Did you formally study makeup/beauty?</strong> I did! I received my certification in professional makeup artistry from Joe Blasco Makeup School in 2007. After that I attended cosmetology school and am currently a licensed cosmetologist as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re pretty big on the creative scene. Do you find that being a creative person in general helps you with the upkeep and maintenance surrounding your blog?</strong> I think being involved in several different creative outlets helps to cultivate ideas for sure. I genuinely enjoy all aspects of beauty blogging too – makeup, writing, photography, etc. – so I think that makes things easier as well because it doesn’t feel like work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite must-use beauty product?</strong> Image Skincare Ormedic Balancing Lip Enhancement Complex. I have a tube on me at all times!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gush: what’s your favorite drugstore brand?</strong> That’s such a toughie! I’d say it’s a tie between CoverGirl and Sonia Kashuk</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your look: you seem to emulate that pin-up girl look so well! Is that your signature “beauty” style? If not, what is?</strong> Thank you so much! I love to wear the pin-up look because I love that era, but it also works well with my skin tone and coloring. I also love a smokey eye and a light pink lip every now and then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you began blogging?</strong>\nIt seems like cool things keep popping up all over (which is amazing!), but being featured in Allure is still my favorite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you stumble into all of the amazing press you’ve had thus far? Have you had to push for it, or do you find that people come to you?</strong> For the most part it has been people reaching out to me… which I am so thankful for!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk about networking and social media: do you find that social platforms have helped with the success of Martinis and Mascara? How so?</strong> Social media has helped tremendously! I find that social platforms, especially Twitter, have boosted my readership so much. It’s amazing how many new people you can reach with a simple hashtag or by being retweeted by a brand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Blue!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Red or nude lipstick?</strong> I like them both, but I love a good red lip!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glitter or shimmer eyeshadow?</strong> I know I shouldn’t say this, but I’m going with glitter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you only had one beauty product in your arsenal, what would it be, and why?</strong> Mascara! It opens the eye and I think it makes you look beautiful instantly even if you have nothing else on your face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A picture is worth 1,000 words - especially when it comes to beauty. Do you have any tips/tricks/must-use photography techniques that you always implement when snapping away for Martinis and Mascara?</strong> Lighting is key! I try to make sure my photos are always well lit so it really showcases the true colors of the products I’m shooting. I also like to make sure the photos are clean and not too busy. If I’m shooting a photo of myself I make sure to always utilize the proper (aka flattering) angles (taken from above at a diagonal, facing the light source).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to your best friend, who just told you she was going to launch a beauty blog, what would it be and why?</strong> I would tell her to dive in head first and just keep swimming! So many people get into it and want to put a timeline on when they’ll have a big audience or when they’ll make a lot of money… but I think if you just keep plugging along, all of those things will fall into place.</p>\n"

She proves it in her well-dressed posts with effortless color blocking and pattern mixing. Lucky for readers, she also shares her sweeter than sugar DIY ideas. Be prepared to want to dress and cook better. Let Krista show you how!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sugar Love Chic is oozing with life, color, and energy! Tell us about how you got started.Like many bloggers, the start of my blog began with a need for a creative outlet.</strong> The inspiration I was able to share with others and receive back from fellow bloggers fueled the continuation of Sugar Love Chic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did the name come from?</strong> Pretty simple. “Sugar” came from the homemade recipes I share. “Love” came from how I feel about blogging. And “Chic” came from the style posts I share.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I’ve been the voice behind Sugar Love Chic for roughly a year and a half.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You love coffee! How do you take it? Black, milk, sugar…</strong> My favorite style of coffee is a latte. Vanilla, Hazelnut, Mexican Mocha… if it’s a latte, I’ll drink it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You don’t only blog about style, but you blog about sweet treats (like those divine looking lemon donuts with raspberry icing) and beauty. What’s your favorite category to blog under - and why?</strong> While creating and sharing recipes is so fun, putting together outfits (including beauty finds) is often more rewarding. I love hearing that my readers were inspired to recreate the outfit, especially if they tell me that means getting out of their comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a total pro when it comes to taking photographs on a stark white background. What’s your secret - how do you get the perfect lighting (equipment?) and what camera do you use?</strong> It takes lots of patience and time. I really depend on natural lighting and have even decided what time of the day is the best to shoot, which I think is a couple hours before sunset. Also, when shooting food, I remember most times that less is more. I use a Canon Rebel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You hail from Miami, Florida (we’re jealous, it’s freezing in NYC!). How does South Florida culture inspire your personal style (and your cooking!)?</strong> Living in Miami is probably one of the aspects of my life that plays the biggest role in my styling. My style revolves around pops of color just like my city. I also focus on wardrobe pieces that work in warm climates, but remain classy and effortless. Because of that, it’s also really important to me to blog style posts that can also work in cooler climates, so I try and cerate outfits that can be layered. While I love my Hispanic and Caribbean food, which is the majority of what you’ll find in Miami, I don’t blog many recipes that stem from those types of cuisine. I just may start doing that more often!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glitter or confetti?</strong> Confetti means PAR-TAY.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pineapple or coconut?</strong> Pina Colada. So, both!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your Instagram screams “follow me”. Aside from your insta-perfect photos, how do you manage to keep a loyal following?</strong> One thing I have realized is that an Instagram account can be dedicated to a blog, but followers take interest and enjoy seeing snippets of the blogger’s life. Love, family, pets, delicious brunch outings. It’s important to share those pictures of your everyday life with your followers, it creates a great connection!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your personal style photos for you?</strong> When my fiancé is in town, he travels a lot as a pro baseball player, then he takes on that cherished role ha! (He actually does love it.) When he isn’t, my wonderful and creative mom helps me get the perfect shot. I’m a lucky gal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time, or part-time? If you blog part-time, what do you do to manage/balance your week schedule? Any time management tips?</strong> I probably blog a little more than part-time, a little less than full-time. It really depends on my current life schedule, but planning posts a week or two in advance always helps. It can get really busy and a little stressful, especially when having deadlines while working with brands and boutiques, but the most important thing I’ve learned is too never stop being present in real-life due to your blogger-life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your experience, what’s been the biggest perk about operating and writing for your own blog thus far?</strong> The people you inspire/ are inspired by and the connections you make.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your go-to everyday must-use beauty product?</strong> Lorax Multi-Plex 3D Lashes. Google it, then buy it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to give a few words of advice to a newbie blogger, what would they be?</strong> Be true to who you are, it never goes out of style. Get involved with the blogging community. Never be “too big” to reply to readers’ comments. Have fun!</p>\n"

With her paired-up prints and pretty poses, Kate is fancy indeed. Learn more about her and** For the Love of Fancy** through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel that your southern location in Houston, Texas influences your personal style?</strong> Absolutely! I have lived in Houston my entire life and have a southern soul and fashion sense. I truly believe that fashion varies in different regions of the United States. As for my personal style, I gravitate to pastels, plaids, seersucker, and bright patterns (think Lilly Pulitzer!). All of these make me think of southern style. I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, and I saw a big difference in fashion up there! Living in Houston has definitely helped to define how my style is today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You vow to wear every outfit more than once. Why is this important?</strong>\nI actually haven’t always been this way! I used to think an outfit could be worn only once. One and done, as they say. I slowly have come to realize that an outfit can be mixed and matched in such a way, that you would never even remember you had worn it before! I love to take pieces from a certain outfit and mix it in different ways so that it feels new to me. I finally feel like I’m getting more bang for my fashion buck, and that’s important.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I have only been blogging since January of this year! I absolutely love it. I majored in fashion merchandising in college, and my job has nothing to do with fashion. Blogging has been the perfect outlet for me to do the thing I enjoy so much. It lets me be creative and I have fun with it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Simply put, I have always had a thing for well, fancy things. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t discriminate when it comes to fashion, but it is no surprise that I love to dress fancy, see fancy places, and just simply be fancy. This name just seemed perfect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You post mostly about personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> I would describe my style as classic, feminine, and fun. I love a good classic piece that can be worn time and time again in different ways. I love to match a piece like this in a fun way, tying in current fashion trends. My feminine style shows through my skirts, heels, and fun accessories. While I do follow current fashion trends, I love to dress how I feel most comfortable in my own skin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are marrying your best friend in April. Can you give us some hints about your bridal style?</strong> Fancy! Who would have thought? Ever since I was a little girl, I have always known I did not want a Cinderella-style wedding gown. I am 5’11 and knew I wanted something that would accentuate that, while still being classic. I knew I wanted a hint of sparkle, without being over the top. Without giving too much away (yet!), I found the most perfect dress, feminine, elegant, and perfect for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was the process of starting your blog like?</strong> A lot of work! But so, SO, worth it! I think people look at blogging and think it’s all glamorous and easy, but in reality, a lot of work is put into it! I had a fabulous website designer that made my process a thousand times easier, thank goodness. In every post, a lot goes into it! While you may only post 6 or 8 pictures in any given post, there are probably about 75 pictures that are taken! Then, these are narrowed down and edited, resulting in the final few that make the cut for the post. I also try to be pretty vocal on my posts, really describing what I am wearing, why I chose it, what else I would pair it with, etc. So, like I said, a lot of work goes into this! But it is absolutely worth every second.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you ever want to delve into other categories, like beauty?</strong> Yes! Right now, I am focusing on fashion, because that’s what I feel I am best at. I have however, had many questions on my hair and makeup styling, so I would love to eventually dabble in beauty as well!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> Honestly, so far it’s been the fabulous other women I have connected with! There are so many talented, fashionable women who blog, that I look up to so much! I love that the blogging community is so open and welcoming, ideas are shared, advice is given, and we all just have fun doing what we love!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My J.Crew white button down shirt, my black Nine West point-toe pumps, my Louis Vuitton bag, my Gap boyfriend jeans, and my Michael Kors Runway Watch. Like I said before, I am all about classics. At least one of these pieces pop up in my outfits several times a week. They’re staples in my wardrobe and can really go with just about anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your go-to colors?</strong> If I said pink would you be shocked? I love pinks, yellows, and blues. Those are probably my most worn colors. I tend to be drawn to those when I am out shopping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you more into basics or trendy pieces?</strong> Can I say both? If you’ve read my previous answers, you already know how I feel about classics. Basics are great, but I also love to mix in trendy pieces as well! I really like to give every trend a try, and sometimes I really end up loving it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How important is it to accessorize?</strong> KEY. 100% important. There have been days when I throw on a pair of boyfriend jeans and a plain v-neck tee and just feel really blah. Simple solution? A stunner of a necklace and a great handbag, and I am good to go! Accessories really are everything. They can turn something ordinary into something fabulous in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for people stuck in a style rut?</strong> Pick a current trend and just go for it! What do you have to lose? If you don’t like it, that’s okay! But it can’t hurt to try. Some people will be surprised with how it turns out. I used to be opposed to patterns, and now I’m drawn to the brightest, boldest patterns out there! If you’re still hesitant, ease into it. If you wear neutral colors, start small. Add a colored necklace or a pair of colored shoes to an outfit and see how that makes you feel. I admit, some trends can seem intimidating at first! But like I said, if you feel like you’re in a rut, GO FOR IT! It’s the best way to turn your wardrobe around.</p>\n"

She blogs about personal style, beauty routines, and of course taking care of her luscious locks. A Dominican living in LA, she writes in English and Spanish to reach a wide array of readers. Her two little curly girls keep her busy life playful with their mutual love of glitter and pink. Learn more about Daily’s world and her blogging journey with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You review a lot of beauty products and come up with lots of hair and beauty DIYs. How do you decide which products to try and which DIYs to share?</strong> For the hair products part, a mix of factors influence whether I review it or not, I want to keep a balance in the blog and I don’t want it to be all about reviews, so I always pay attention to my readers comments and requests. New products and trend products also have a big possibility to be reviewed. As for DIY, the inspiration comes every day, I am a mom, so a few hours of my day are spent in the kitchen, I can be doing a carrot juice and hair comes to my mind, is carrot juice good for hair? can I apply it to my hair? I put my apron aside, sit on my computer, do a lot of research and then try it on my own it..</p>\n\n<p><strong>You write your posts in both English and Spanish. Why is this important?</strong> This is really important to me, because the Latin community has little information about natural hair, it is double the work but double the satisfaction. Spanish is my language, my identity, quien soy. I love having a voice in a language that latinas can understand and rely on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You found some gorgeous curls to photograph at New York Fashion Week. How was the experience of attending?</strong> I am in California and my friend (and journalist) Francis was there, so I called her and ask her to cover the event for me. She was surprised on how many women showed up in one of the most important fashion shows wearing their natural texture, where long ago they would be spending hours at a hair salon straightening their hair, women are realizing that natural hair is fashionable and trendy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My style is safe, with a touch of modernism. I don’t get drowned in trends, but I do try to get inspiration while sticking to my own style. We can call it casual, to put a name on it… Ever since I went natural though, I am taking more risks and playing with colors and textures that I though weren’t right for my skin color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite colors to wear?</strong> Black (lol don’t we all love it) - black is so flattering, but like I said before, I am playing with texture that was prohibited for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you gravitate more toward basics or bold prints?</strong> Basics all the way, bold prints to have fun and get out of my comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends are you excited to try this spring?</strong> I am so ready to wear Orange in it’s different hues in clothes, bags, and shoes. The crop tops are so cute and really trendy for spring, but I don’t think I will be wearing it. White wide-legged pants is something I am really excited as well and graphics, prints, and patterns</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you first start blogging?</strong> That is a funny story, because I started my Facebook page first and a fan said “you should start a blog”. So I did that very night.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has your blog changed and grown over time?</strong> Tremendously, I didn’t quite know that I had a voice and that people wanted to hear what I had to say. That made me study and invest in my blog to give my readers better content every day, they give so much love that I can’t do it any other way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen to you through the blogging process?</strong> A lot of cool stuff has happened to me through blogging, but the coolest thing is the love my readers give me every day through a simple comment, they support me in so many ways that I feel grateful and that is super cool.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What exciting changes or events do you have planned for the future?</strong> I have a lot of plans for my blogging, but in the near future I will be focusing on networking. For that reason I will be attending a few conferences around US and just continuing to be me and do me..</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?</strong> Don’t get caught in stereotypes and what other people think. “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> That with hard work and consistency, you can achieve anything you want in life. Blogging has made me a more confident woman that is able to pass it on to her children, friends and thousands of women that want to hear and read what I have to say.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for fellow curly-haired girls, or anyone wanting to start a blog?</strong> Just go for it, but try to write about something that excites you. And be you, because everyone else is taken.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>As one of Blogspotter’s youngest minds, <strong>Maggie Royce</strong> of <strong>Maggie Royce</strong> brings a unique perspective to the table. She aims to dress classier than other teens, turning to pieces that would ordinarily be considered “adult” and wearing them in her own fun way. She gravitates toward unexpected color combinations like pink and red and is not afraid to mix prints. She is similarly fearless when it comes to sharing her opinions. Maggie will tell it like it is, and she is #sorrynotsorry about it.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>At 13, you are our youngest blogger yet! Why do you think it is important to have young, fresh perspectives out there in the blogosphere?</strong> It is important to have such young perspectives because we are the growing age of fashion. Someday the fashion industry will be us teens, but grown up, so why not start now? Also, fashion needs to be able to have fun which is what us teenagers bring to the table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long ago did you start your blog and why?</strong> I started officially blogging the summer of third grade after moving to NC. My dad is involved in the media world so he suggested I blog! Last year I “reset” my blog to make it less “tweenybopper” and have been on it ever since!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about personal style, beauty, and happenings in your daily life. Which of these is your favorite to post about?</strong> My favorite is when I mix my personal style with my daily life. When I put an outfit post I’ll relate it back to my life giving readers a chance to know me. I never want to be the girl who only posts outfit photos or only gives studying advice because why not have fun with trying everything?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your personal style is “preppy”. Give us more details about your wardrobe.</strong> I would say I am very “preppy” but I mainly focus on trying to dress “classier” than the average teen. Most girls my age love tightfitting skirts and crop tops whereas I gravitate towards twirly dresses and blazers. I love taking adult-esque pieces and sassing them up a bit to make them my own. My closet has a ton of fun different colored pants, statement necklaces and way too many stripes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which item(s) in your closet could you never live without?</strong> I could never live without my fuchsia Tieks, my navy with white tipped blazer and my hairbows. My hair is short so my bows add a lot to my look! Tieks are SO comfy and add a huge pop of color to my outfits. The blazer dresses up my look and makes me feel so fabulous. I love having pieces that make you feel like a million bucks, which my blazer is one of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from blogging, what are some of your favorite things to do?</strong> I love baking, golfing and spend way too much time on Pinterest with my Mom. Cliché middleschool sleepovers with my best friends are one of my all-time loves, there’s something fun about getting n-o sleep. Also I love surfing, sailing and going to the beach in the warmer months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Maintaining a blog has taught me that I have my own opinion and that it’s ok for me to say what I’d like. I’ve became so much more confident since restarting my blog and it shows. My blog has taught me networking skills which has helped me online and off! It has also taught me that I have to believe in myself and not to care what others think. In middle school, the thought of “putting yourself out there” is unheard of. Blogging has taught me to have very thick skin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are an avid thrifter. What is the coolest bargain treasure that you’ve found?</strong> So far it has been my most recent thrift from a consignment store up in New England. My mom (partner in crime) found an amazing long sleeve Lilly Pulitzer tunic. It has pink and green scallops with giraffes, totally retro early Lilly! Not to mention it was $15, a total steal!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from navy and pink (love), what are your other go-to colors and patterns?</strong> I’ve fallen in love with the combination of pink &amp; red. It looks so fun and bright, totally unexpected! Also I love grey and pink (I really love pink), it is a super transitional color scheme.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you balance a busy lifestyle and blogging?</strong> I’ve been working on prioritizing things! Blogging comes second to school/life so my posts aren’t as frequent as I’d like. Instead of using one planner I use my school planner (given to me by my school) as well as a notebook filled with to-do lists. It’s crazy but somehow I somewhat manage!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends are you excited to try this spring?</strong> I tend not to gravitate towards “trendy” overhyped pieces but I’d love the look of mixing patterns! It isn’t super “springy” or “trendy” but I love it. Pastels look adorable but aren’t flattering on me. I would wear them if they actually looked good!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the most interesting thing to happen since you started blogging?</strong> Hands down, being invited to fashion week! I couldn’t attend since I recently had surgery along with school but oh my gosh how I wanted to go! It was unexplainably the best feeling ever to receive the email asking if I could go. Also I was featured in Girls Life Magazine a few years back which was surreal!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> You don’t have to pay a lot to look cute! I see girls flocking to the most expensive items because they’re more expensive but really, you don’t have to. While it is fun to splurge every once in a while, you don’t always have to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring teen bloggers?</strong> Stay a teen! There are way too many teens falling into posting about “coffee table books” and “eye creams” (no - but really they do) which can be fun, but teens have many years before they need to worry about that! If you’re a teen blogger, most likely other teens will be reading your blog and definitely don’t care about eye creams… #sorrynotsorry</p>\n"

Visit Dainty and Decadent for a little bit of everything, including snaps of her sweet son Lucas. Learn more about Maria through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You started blogging as a way to document the end of your twenties. Were there any other reasons you started? What made you continue?</strong> I guess to hold me accountable. That’s a strange way of putting it but I found myself in a rut and thought if I starting documenting my life, outfits, etc., I wouldn’t get so lazy. Now, that I’m a mom, I want to document every aspect of my son’s life so I never forget these moments. So I continue blogging to document this awesome time right now and because I love connecting with readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> The name, honestly, came about because I liked both words. I wish there was a deeper reason!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has being a mommy changed your fashion choices at all?</strong> Absolutely! I get dressed before my son wakes up so I always choose to wear something comfortable because I know as soon as he’s up, I’m going to be running around.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would say classic and comfortable. Sometimes people associate the word comfortable with boring but I think, at least for myself, if I’m not comfortable, I’m not going to feel great which will translate into whatever I’m wearing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Tory Burch flats, Maxi Dress, Boyfriend Cardigan, Louis Vuitton Speedy, Chanel Flap (totally not practical but it’s my love!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your most-loved color and texture combinations?</strong> Black and White. Simple and Classic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As an attorney, does your work style differ from your normal, everyday style?</strong> My normal, everyday style is very relaxed versus what I wear to work which is usually a pencil skirt and top. You never know if there’s going to be an emergency hearing so I always dress for work with that in mind and know that I can throw a blazer on and be ready to go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> I had my son! I loved blogging my pregnancy outfits and sometimes go back through my archives just to see my massive preggo belly!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was the process of starting your blog like?</strong> Thankfully, my husband is supportive and tech savvy. He very much built the blog for me and taught me how to manage it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> Diligence. Sometimes I skip days here and there in posting but then I get the urge to want to do 5 posts in a row. I just love blogging and getting inspiration from others too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the Modcloth Uniquely You campaign and what that entailed. Have you been involved in any similar projects?</strong> The Modcloth Uniquely You campaign was so much fun because it was like I got to shop and create my perfect outfit! I’ve never been involved with another project like that before but I certainly will enjoy the opportunity to get to do it again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any plans for your blog’s future?</strong> My life is certainly changing (for the best) and so I hope to share more about being a working mother, sharing outfit ideas, and, of course, my little fashionable son, Lucas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring mommy bloggers?</strong> Mommy blogs are definitely one of my favorites to read and I love when mommy bloggers are honest. My advice is to try not to be like anyone else but yourself.</p>\n"

Lucky her, she resides in South Florida and gets to rock bright colors and open-toe shoes all year round. She believes that women are not always accurately represented in the media and that fashion bloggers are an antidote to that. Be inspired by Rachelle’s confident style and her refreshing outlook to match!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>As a blogger from South Florida, how does your location play into your clothing and color choices?</strong> I often joke that in Florida we have 2 seasons - hot and hotter. So of course I can get away with wearing bold colors, short skirts and sandals pretty much all year long. I am not complaining at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you decide to start?</strong> I started this blog with my sister in 2011, but we gave up after a few posts. On June 1st 2012, I decided to start again on my own this time and never looked back. I always loved fashion, as a teenager I spent countless hours watching Fashion TV so this blog was my creative outlet and my way of sharing my love for fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Describe the process of launching your blog.</strong> I’m a computer science major so the technical part was pretty easy for me, but I did a lot of research Google, books and by following other bloggers that I admire. When I first started I wanted to keep my expenses to a minimum so I signed up to a free platform, but once I got comfortable and knew that I wanted to keep going, I made little and big investments here and there. Now I have a self-hosted blog on Wordpress, I bought a DSLR and my latest was to upgrade to Photoshop CC.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you choose your blog’s name and the fonts and color scheme to go along with it?</strong> I am a die-hard shoe lover, and one day I was talking to my sister about how cool it would be to have shoes with pink bottoms, kind of like Louboutins but with pink instead of red and that’s how I came up with PinkSole. As far as color scheme, I love a clean and sharp design so I usually stick with black and white with a touch of pink. Currently I am considering doing a blog redesign, so I am getting a new header done for me, and I am currently shopping for a new theme. Stay tuned!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would say my style is feminine, classic with an edge. I love basic pieces and I felt like I had the ones that I needed, I started added a variety of prints and colors. I am also a very moody dresser; it all depends on how I’m feeling that particular day. If my outfit is too sweet I always feel the need to toughen it up a bit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> My top 3 stores are: J.Crew for professional and fun pieces, ASOS to find unique non-professional pieces, Gap for my basics (such as tees, shirts and jeans), Nordstrom because it has pretty much everything and they always have amazing sales going on. I am blessed to live close to one of the biggest outlet malls in South Florida, you can easily find me browsing Saks, Bloomindale’s, Cole Haan, Barney’s and more hunting for designer deals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What item(s) in your closet could you never replace?</strong> My BCBG prom dress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Basics with bold accessories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you find style inspiration?</strong> Pinterest, other bloggers, magazines(I’m that girl that takes pictures of a runway looks she saw to make her ready-to-wear version) and myself (I know I did not invent anything new but the outfits that my readers love the most are usually the ones that I put together without overthinking).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much time does a typical blog post take up?</strong> Once I’m dressed, 15 minutes to shoot, now that I’m more comfortable with Photoshop about 30 minutes to choose my favorite shots and edit. And the actual posting on the site can take 45 minutes to an hour. So we can round it up to 2 hours, if I am wearing items that are no longer in stores it is always a hassle to find very similar pieces, but I love to make my posts as accurate as possible to please my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging worked out for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> Blogging has been amazing so far and I often refer to my blog as my boyfriend (it’s sad - I know). But really - I’ve met so many wonderful bloggers that have become friends and I am always amazed to find out they are brands that want to work with me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen since you started blogging?</strong> So many great things happened since I started blogging, getting to partner with brands such as Toms, Hollister, Lacoste and more. Getting featured on Lucky Magazine’s Facebook, Gap recently pinned on of my photos and to me that was epic considering these are brands that I genuinely love.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining your blog taught you?</strong> To be consistent. Trust me, some days the last thing I want to do is take pictures of myself!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> I feel like fashion bloggers are sometimes portrayed as vain people who like to take pictures of themselves. But the women represented in the media, do not look anything like me or the majority of women really. So I think that’s where fashion bloggers are valuable, I want to help my readers to be confident and to know that you can carry yourself well and look good without fitting that mold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for working twenty-somethings who want to blog on the side?</strong> Blogging on the side is pretty much like a part-time job, so make sure to blog about something you are passionate about because it is not all rainbows and bunnies.</p>\n"

A New York City transplant by way of New Hampshire, she owns her city girl style and we can’t look away from her transformation. Her place in the fashion industry seems justified as she guides us through her life and wardrobe full of equal parts current and vintage. She hasn’t been an NYC resident for long, but she sure does fit in!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you want to target your blog toward twenty-somethings?</strong> Twenty-somethings are the perfect target for me because I am one! I want to help expose my readers beyond the other blogs that feature out-of-reach luxury items with world travels and super high-end products. I do feature expensive pieces every now and then (secret: most of them are second-hand!), and I love to post them with less expensive items in the same look; whether they be from Goodwill or Forever 21. It’s all about how you style things together. I hope that I’m able to show other twenty-somethings, and girls as young as my tween little sister to women my grandmother’s age, that they can still be fabulous- even on a budget.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about everything from food to fashion. Why did you want to cover so many topics?</strong> I chose to write a lifestyle blog rather than just a fashion blog because while fashion is a huge part of my life, I’m also a pretty crafty gal and I’ve found a passion for cooking too! I also wanted to share parts of my life with my readers as lessons or what to or not to do. I’ve learned so much living independently and making the decision to leave New Hampshire. From what I’ve heard, people are pretty interested in hearing all about my life from different aspects, so that’s what I try to give them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which subject is your favorite to blog about?</strong> My favorite subject to blog about is definitely fashion. When I get ready in the morning, I always think about what will look best as an outfit inspiration post for LTT. Then being able to describe my thought process on how I chose what I’m wearing or where I got my inspiration from is really what makes my blog relatable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My personal style is different from day to day. When I go to work, I can be very professional in a pencil skirt. Outside of work, I love to go in my closet and pull a bunch of different things together; prints, patterns, jewelry, accessories. Sometimes I probably look ridiculous, but the best part about living in NYC is that no one cares how crazy you look!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find yourself gravitating more toward basics or trendy pieces?</strong> I can’t really say either. I like trendy styles, but I use them more for inspiration on how to dress myself. Trends come and go too quickly; I’d rather make my own trends for myself and tag “Trend Alert” on LTT. Who knows, maybe I’ll get enough of my followers to help make one of my trends popular!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You grew up in a small town and moved to New York City. How has becoming a city girl changed your fashion choices?</strong> I have learned not to focus as much on how other people think I look, but rather on how I want my own personal style to be and what I feel good in. When I first moved here, you could find me decked out in Juicy tracksuits and Abercrombie. After a few months, I realized that I wanted to be less mainstream and started finding my own style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the experience of attending New York Fashion Week.</strong> New York Fashion Week is always so exciting. The feeling is similar to that of Christmas Eve; I get so excited to see what each show brings and more excited to see who they bring! I also love seeing what everyone wears to the shows- it’s almost as important as what’s actually on the runways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop?</strong> My favorite places to shop have come to be thrift and vintage stores. If you ever told 17 year old Stephanie that when I was older I’d be shopping at second-hand stores, I’d never have believed it. It makes creating my own style much more individualistic because everything is pretty much one of a kind. Some of my favorites are Housing Works, Buffalo Exchange and Rabbits (Brooklyn).</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you’re not blogging, what are some other things you love to do?</strong> When I’m not blogging, I love to cook and try new recipes. I’ve learned it’s best to take pictures of everything because you never know what you’ll be able to use in a blog post! I also love discovering new thrift stores around the city- not only for clothes, but for furniture, accessories, and even craft supplies. I once got an entire bag of buttons for only a dollar. Such a score!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start blogging in the beginning?</strong> My previous job consisted of about 30 girls working in a fashion office. We used to take lunches together every day just to chat and take a break from work. I always told them about the crafts I made the night before or this great new recipe I came up with. After months of telling me, they finally convinced me to start a blog. One thing lead to another, and I can’t thank them enough!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> The most difficult part about maintaining a blog, in addition to having a full-time job, is that I always need to find time for it. Whether it means I get a little less sleep one night or need to stay in and have a glass of wine rather than go out with girlfriends, that’s what I’ll do. I think the most important part of having a blog is keeping up with it- no one wants to read a blog that’s only updated every so often.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the coolest feedback you have gotten since you started?</strong> That’s a tough one. I would have to say hearing from all kinds of people that my blog is an everyday read for them is so cool. From women my mom’s age to my aunts and grandmother, and of course girl’s my own age, I’m so happy that I’m able to inspire such a wide range of women. There’s no better feeling!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> When I first started Let’s Talk Twenties, my main priority was to make every single person that read it feel like they’re fabulous. I talk about different ways to love themselves, healthy recipes, and fashion advice on how to wear different pieces in a unique way. My message to my wonderful readers is you are stinking fabulous- and don’t you forget it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you think you will continue to blog, even past your twenties?</strong> When I named my blog, Let’s Talk Twenties, I was looking for something that I could hopefully use for a few years. Since it’s become such a success, I’m so happy I named it what I did because when the time comes, I’m hoping to continue on with Let’s Talk Thirties! Stay tuned…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring twenty-something bloggers?</strong> My advice to bloggers of any age is to stay true to yourself. I’ve heard from so many people that read LTT that they love it because they’re able to relate to it. Some bloggers write only about luxury items that not everyone can afford, and that’s their prerogative. I think people will continue to follow a blog like mine because it’s different than others that are out there. Find what you’re passionate about and write about it - your passion will come through!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>A southern belle and soon-to-be mommy, <strong>Katy Atlas</strong> of <strong>Sugarlaws</strong> is the sweetest. Her expert ensembles and cheerful color choices are her blog’s main course, while must-try recipes and helpful everyday tips are served for dessert. She has documented her personal style throughout her pregnancy and will undoubtedly pass plenty of fashion wisdom on to her little one. Oh, and her posts are so well-worded for a reason, because she’s also written a book! Peek into Katy’s full life and learn more about Sugar Laws with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is your blog called Sugarlaws? Does it have to do with your sweet tooth?</strong> Sugarlaws actually started as a food and recipe blog for the first year and a half! I added fashion in 2009, so people sometimes forget that it was about food before it was about fashion!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog about food and style. Why did you decide to cover both topics on one blog?</strong> Food and fashion are two huge loves of mine, and I couldn’t imagine my life without either! Both food and fashion are about making life beautiful, happy and comfortable – or as I like to say, living sweetly!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I’ve been blogging since 2008, which is about a century in internet-years! I started Sugarlaws as a way to keep track of all the new recipes I was making in my tiny Manhattan kitchen, but it soon became a way to chronicle the last five years of my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the experience of attending New York Fashion Week.</strong> Fashion Week is always such a blast! It’s so incredibly inspiring to see all the hard work and effort come together on the runways, and to get a sense of the styles we’ll all be drooling over in the coming year. I’ve attended eight straight seasons, including this past February at seven months pregnant!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us how you’ve been styling your precious baby bump.</strong> It’s not easy! I’ve been very lucky to have a comfortable pregnancy, so I’ve mostly been focused on tighter clothes that show off my bump! It’s funny, but clothes that I would have shied away from pre-pregnancy – body-con dresses, tight tanks and sweaters – are now my wardrobe staples!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you planning to pass your fashion-savvy ways on to your little one?</strong> I hope so! We’re having a boy, so I’m constantly saving boy inspiration photos for his future style!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You wrote a book! What was that process like?</strong> Long and grueling! I’ve actually written three novels that are all part of a series, and it’s been an incredible challenge but also extremely rewarding. After several years and hundreds of pages, the characters are like my best friends!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> Easy and elegant. I like to keep my outfits comfortable and wearable, but still embrace my favorite trends. And I love a great high-low mix – you’ll see me pairing Chanel with T.J. Maxx or Forever 21 constantly!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you prefer delicate or statement making accessories?</strong> Both! I love delicate pieces, but I tend to always gravitate to statement accessories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neutrals or bold hues?</strong> Bold colors!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is one item in your wardrobe that you could never replace?</strong> The pearl and diamond earring that my mother had custom made for me as my wedding present, that I wore on our wedding day. I only break them out for special occasions, but they’re incredibly special to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How difficult was it to get your blog up and running in the beginning?</strong> It was difficult, but I was so obsessed with it that it hardly felt like work! I was thrilled for every small milestone and victory, from my first email from a reader to my first NYFW invitation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Be true to yourself, live honestly and compassionately, and the rest will flow from there. Focus on the journey and not the reward and you’ll always be satisfied where you are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers interested in fashion and food?</strong> Blogging takes a lot of hard work and dedication, but it’s also the best job you can ever have! Pick something you’re passionate about and even hard work will feel like fun.</p>\n"

From statement necklaces to ladylike dresses, <strong>Kendall Johnson</strong> of <strong>Styled Snapshots</strong> shows you how to pull if off. She works with children and dabbles in photography, all while living in the big apple with her man and adorable pup. We are crushing even harder on Kendall’s style now that we know more about it, and her!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your style so much! Tell us how you got started with blogging.</strong> After years of spending countless hours scrolling through other blogs, I decided it was time to start one of my own. I wanted a place that allowed my creative juices to flow and express myself in a way that positively impacts others. I love mixing high-end with lower-end pieces, and encouraging others to think outside the box when it comes to their wardrobe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The name “Styled Snapshots” flows so well off the tongue. How did you come up with it?</strong> To be honest, the reason it took me so long to start my blog is that I could not think of the perfect name. I always loved taking pictures that capture a perfect moment, especially with fashion and one day it just came to me… Styled Snapshots!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you balance a full-time job and part-time blogging? Any rules of time management that you live by?</strong> It took me awhile to get into the swing of things, and I am still figuring out what works best for me. At first I would stay up late into the night trying to get by on a couple hours of sleep each day, and rush home from work to try and snap a picture before dark.</p>\n\n<p>I realized quickly I had to create a schedule and utilize as much of the weekend as possible. Scheduling posts ahead of time has been the light at the end of the tunnel. Also, keeping a notebook to jot down ideas constantly. Some of my best ideas have come to me in the most obscure places.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s get into style. Your outfits always incorporate a punchy pop of color. If there was only one color in the world to accent your outfits with, what would it be - and why?</strong> This is a tough one! I would have to say a bright pink, whether it be your lip color or a statement necklace, that is a color that catches your eye and adds the perfect punch to any look.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite must-wear accessory right now?</strong> Pave link bracelet, hands down! I pair it with a cluster of bracelets or let it shine on its own, but it adds a fun pop to any outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fashion Week was just here! Were you super excited about any designers in particular?</strong> This was actually my first Fashion Week experience and I was fortunate enough to attend the Jay Godfrey presentation. His fall collection is effortlessly translates the 70’s rock and roll spirit into edgy prints and rich textures. From a sequined hoodie to a two tier bubble skirt, I left there wanting it all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any blogs that you follow on a daily basis? Do they provide you with inspiration, or do you find that living in New York City gives you inspiration in itself?</strong> There are a handful of blogs that I have followed all along in which inspired me to start my own: Gal Meets Glam, Atlantic-Pacific, Pink Peonies and Happily Grey. I have to say though, every day I walk out onto the streets of New York I am inspired by all that surrounds me and it truly is a city where you can try any fashion trend or risk and get away with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?</strong> Thailand! My boyfriend and I have been bit by the travel bug and this is next on our list. We are that couple that starts talking about their next trip the second they get back from the last. It doesn’t hurt to think about somewhere warm since we have had a brutally cold winter!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one piece from one designer, who would it be?</strong> Rebecca Taylor - Her collections are always effortlessly chic, polished and classic while always adding an extra detail of texture or prints to stand out amongst the rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Red matte lips or nude shiny gloss?</strong> Red matte lips! NARS “Heatwave” is a staple in my bag!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Street coffee or Starbucks?</strong> I know, I know, I should pick street coffee since I am a New Yorker, but I can’t let go of my Starbucks… Grande Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte please!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chunky or dainty jewelry?</strong> The chunkier the better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see Styled Snapshots in 3 years?</strong> I hope that it is a site that people wake up and want to check first thing in the morning to gain daily inspiration. I want to continue to grow and build my platform to encourage others that it is ok to mix polkadots and stripes, and you can find a great piece at Forever21 and pair it with something designer to create that perfect look. I want to be able to share my everyday findings with the world and never give up on my dream of one day sitting front row at New York Fashion Week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> The biggest this I learned is that it truly is a 24/7 job, my brain never stops thinking, but it’s a 24/7 job I absolutely love and would never change. Also, the incredible friendships I have formed and how supportive fellow bloggers are of each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your sister was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of advice you would give her?</strong> Buckle up, it is a life changing journey that I would never trade anything for. Stay true to yourself and as cheesy as the saying goes, if you love what you do, you will continue to do it and never stop.</p>\n"

She keeps us chic with hair tutorials and shopping ideas, including but not limited to Piperlime, ASOS, and Zara. Next time you’re in a style rut, consult Emily to hunt for a way out.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a Savannah-based, glitter-obsessed brunette. Tell us a little bit about The Style Hunter and how you came up with the name.</strong> When I first started blogging, I had a different name, and absolutely no photos of myself. I just wanted to have an outlet to express myself creatively. It was basically a glorified Pinterest, before Pinterest was the fabulous beast that it is! The change from that blog, to The Style Hunter was a long time coming. I battled with myself about making the switch to putting myself front and center, literally. The name came from wanting to show my readers that you don’t have to have a full on designer wardrobe to feel good about your style. It’s about finding a look from Pinterest, or a girl you pass by in the grocery store, the look that makes you stop while flipping through a magazine and then “hunting” for how to make that look yours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you decide to start blogging?</strong> I have always been a shopper. Loving all things fashion, burying my nose deep into the September issues of my favorite magazines and mixing patterns and textures. Deemed the fashionable one of my friends, I am the one who brings extra outfits and jewelry on any vacation, just incase anyone needs to borrow. So, the idea to start blogging was a natural one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I have only been The Style Hunter for about 4 or 5 months. I’m a baby blogger, but I have already learned so much and continue to learn every day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has social media played an important role in the growth of The Style Hunter?</strong> Social media is everything. I can’t stress it enough. I have met so many fabulous bloggers via Twitter and Instagram. Pinterest is the ultimate inspiration hub. It’s amazing how you can meet ladies you’ve never actually met face-to-face and know so much about them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from your own blog, do you have a favorite blog? What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong> OhMyGosh… I have so many favorite blogs. Some of my all time favorites are Gal Meets Glam, Happily Grey and my all time style icon Courtney Kerr of What Courtney Wore (and a Bravo-lebrity). She’s literally everything, and if you don’t know her….just look it up! You won’t be sorry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time?</strong> It is definitely a side project for now, but I admire anyone who can make it a full-time job. That would be one of my reach for the sky, knock out of the park dream goals!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I think my style is pretty classic and feminine, with a little bit of edge. I like to take risks and wear things that others might not think about. I like mixing unexpected items, in a way that (fingers crossed…) seems effortless. When shopping I definitely look for shapes that are flattering, a really good pair of jeans (or like 5), and pops of color. I definitely have a few favorites that will always stand out and you will see of too often in my closet. Anything navy. Jumpsuits. Studded pieces. Polka dots. Fur. Stripes. Oversized baubles. Boyfriend button up shirts. Leggings. Nail Polish. Leather.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fashion week is here! You’re in Savannah, Georgia, so do you watch the shows via live streams from Lincoln Center? If so, do you have any favorite trends you’ve spotted on the runway?</strong> Instagram, Instagram, Instagram. All bets are off for New York Fashion Week as I shamelessly stalked my all-time favorite bloggers who kept me feeling like I was right there in-between Anna Wintour and Anna Kendrick, getting an up close and personal look at every look and videos of the final walks. Style.com is also a go-to for everything NYFW. Up close and personal.</p>\n\n<p>As for favorite trends, I am drooling over Tory Burch and her mix of prints, textures and over-the-knee “Catholic School Girl” socks. Alice + Olivia was literally a dream. Filled with luxe details like fur, lace and rich hues. Y’all it was something else. Another favorite of mine was Milly. It looks like a very luxurious and well-dressed ballerina was floating all the way down that runway. There are a pair of fringe pants that are sheer perfection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us one unconventional thing that blogging has taught you.</strong> The one thing that surprised me is feeling like other bloggers are your besties after one bonding sesh over the latest J. Crew collection or what happened on The Bachelor via Twitter. The community that bloggers have made is amazing, and one I am super proud to be a part of! I have met so many fabulous, and clearly fashionable ladies through the Southern Blog Society, which I am a member of. Look them up for TONS of awesome gals!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photos are perfect. What kind of camera do you use?</strong> Ohmy! Way to make a gal blush! I however, can take none of the credit when it comes to my photography. I am beyond lucky to have known my photographer since diapers. Marianne Brown of Marianne Lucille Photography, is a local photographer in Savannah, who puts up with my giggly fits whenever I get in front of the camera and manages to grab some gorgeous shots! We have been lifelong friends and she is amazing! She uses a Canon 60D and a 50mm 1.4 lens. She likes to use Lightroom to edit the pictures, while deleting the ones I look absolutely ridiculous in, and the VSCOfilm presets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> Nothing! I am still a little bit of a newbie, so I can’t quite say I’ve done anything I regret. I think as long as you are authentic there is nothing to regret or change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wedges or pumps?</strong> Wedges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sequins or glitter?</strong> Now this is a toughy. I love sparkle, in all forms. So I guess I would say sequins for clothes and glitter for DIY projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aviators or Jackie-O’s?</strong> Aviators. I absolutely LOVE the mirrored trend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Be authentic. Have a clear picture of what you want to accomplish with your blog. Readers often look at bloggers as if they are experts, so be one. Put time and effort into your photos. Quality photography makes all the difference! It shows your readers that you care about what you are giving them, so they will be more likely to buy into it. And patience. I am still learning this one. Just because you start posting consistently, doesn’t mean you will magically become blogger famous (sad day!). Comments will come, followers will happen, just remember that it takes time and work.</p>\n"

It is a more detailed look into the outfits and mind of <strong>Carsla Peyton</strong>, a writer and entrepreneur creating from Las Vegas. In her posts, she zeroes in on her outfits and each component that makes them special. Once you start scrolling, you won’t be able to stop. Delve deeper into Carsla’s thoughtful world, through Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Connect-the-Cloths has a very interesting look and layout. What made you go so non-traditional as compared to other fashion blogs?</strong> For years I possessed the role of a ‘blog creep’, as I term it. I was a reblog addict on Tumblr &amp; an obsessive liker on Bloglovin’ for years before I thought, “Why aren’t I doing this myself?”. From my observations of skimming through other blogs I adored, I came to the conclusion that no one really cared about the copy, visuals prevailed. So, when I started my blog I wanted to go for a layout that primarily showcased photography to reel readers in. Although, a great majority of my views are on the home page (where most of the photography is featured), I believe I am slowing gaining a following based on my writing alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your posts, you focus a lot on writing. Do you feel that writing is just as important as visual images in the fashion world?</strong> I am a writer at heart; thus, naturally, I utilize my blog to tell my fashion story. Whether through words or photographs, I feel as if it’s important to simply be relatable. A great majority of fashion bloggers I’ve come across seem to live by the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words”; therefore, they may not feel a lot or any copy is necessary. For some, the mystery is part of their image. Yet, I desired to provide viewers with both since I always craved to ‘know’ my favorite bloggers beyond what I envisioned their lives to be via visual representations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe the personal style showcased on your blog?</strong> I have always naturally possessed a style that tends to fit into the ‘urban prep’ category. I’m sure it has a lot to do with being ethnic in suburbia. I loved drawing inspiration from my peers, but my emulation of their style seemed too tame for my taste. Therefore, I utilized fashion as a creative expression.</p>\n\n<p>I put my personal twist on trends with some unexpected, &amp; often, controversial pieces. Once I attended university, I began to frown upon ‘trendy’ fashions (due to my limited budget) &amp; go for more traditional pieces. With a bit of experimentation, I discovered an effortless personal style that worked for me on an everyday basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are a self-proclaimed ex-shopaholic. How do you mix and match the pieces you already own to come up with fabulous new outfits?</strong> I’ve always received amazed reactions from my peers in that I never literally wear the same thing twice. In my lifetime, I’ve subscribed to nearly every fashion publication, &amp; Lucky’s ongoing feature of “One Item, Multiple Ways to Wear”, was always a source of inspiration. From my past shopaholic ways, I learned to stop buying so much junk that I liked at the moment &amp; go for items I believed I absolutely could not live without.</p>\n\n<p>With age &amp; maturity, I learned self control. My rule of thumb while shopping is to browse through every single piece featured in a retail shop before making an investment. In the end, the items in which I’m daydreaming of styling in multiple ways are the only ones that deserve a home in my closet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connect-the-Cloths is fairly new and still “in development” but seems to be taking off. How difficult was it to get it up and running in the beginning?</strong>\nThere were so many days I was discouraged because I received zero traffic for posts I spilled my heart &amp; soul in to &amp; I did not understand why. I truly considered myself to be technologically savvy until I began blogging, &amp; I then realized what little knowledge I truly possessed.</p>\n\n<p>I still to this day know nothing about SEO, but when it comes to tags, I never hold back. If you view my Instagram, you will notice I am a “Hashtag Queen”. They are fun to me, to the point that my tags convey stories or even poems. I tend to get really crafty. All in all, YouTube was my savior. Many of my favorite mainstream bloggers have channels that I studied. And whenever they reached a follower milestone, they would often spill ‘secrets’ to their blogging success.</p>\n\n<p>One in particular mentioned something along the lines of having no traffic expectations for the first sixth months. Content should be the only focus during this trial period &amp; that is a philosophy I live by to this day. My only goal right now is to discover an effortless blogging style &amp; to provide viewers with quality content in every single post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you so far?</strong> Surprisingly, blogging has been my greatest source of self discovery. I have learned to master balancing my logic and rationality with my states of emotion, which I never would’ve expected. Yes, my blog is a representation of my business, but one must be able to connect with people in order to expand. Blogging motivated me to let go of my procrastinating ways which I have found were rooted in a sense of self doubt. I try my best to be a realist &amp; not sugarcoat the process. I am not afraid to share my downfalls and rejections as much as my triumphs and achievements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does it sometimes take more than one post to capture and explain the details of your outfits?</strong> As I storyteller, I believe I adopted the habit of two part series mostly due to ‘dramatics’. But I have found the first post is usually more personal &amp; there is a greater focus on ‘deep’ creative writing, while the second part is lighthearted &amp; has more of an emphasis on outfit details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some items in your wardrobe you could never live without?</strong> Anything that bears the name of Max Azria is prized. He is my favorite designer, &amp; he has the greatest impact on my style philosophy. I appreciate the versatility of his empire from the more affordable BCBG Generation collection to the lavish Herve Leger collection. His work captures effortless style, not just fashions of the time. He is an appreciator of intricate details; every item tells a story. In my book, he is truly genius.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You love to take plain pieces and style them with flashy accessories. Which do you think is more important, the clothing or the accessories?</strong> At this very moment, I am tempted to say accessories since I have been purchasing them more than clothing items lately. But, I truly believe they are compliments of each other. Accessories have the power to make or break an outfit. But, without the right garments, an ensemble will quickly fall to pieces. It’s all about balance. Since I’m building a collection of more traditional, classic threads, I utilize accessories to spice up my plain pieces a bit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Easy, two words: Be Yourself!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you plan to keep growing and improving Connect-the-Cloths?</strong> With patience &amp; consistency, I can’t even imagine where Connect-the-Cloths will take me. I’m excited to see what happens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring stylists, foodies, or writers?</strong> Find yourself, seek your passion, then exploit them both. Forget about the odds or perceived setbacks. Ignore sources of doubts, and just explore where this mindset can take you. To be quite honest, I’ve found the greatest battle of all is conquering impatience.</p>\n"

Meet Amy Black with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about you and your self-titled blog.</strong> I launched Amy’s Vintage Closet at the end of 2011. I was looking for a creative outlet and space where I could showcase my love for all things fashion, specifically thrifted or vintage items. From a young age I can remember mixing and matching things, constantly changing my clothing and always feeling excited by a great find or buy.</p>\n\n<p>I manage my family’s pizzerias. The average day for a restaurant manager is far from glamorous. As our company grew and my job became more demanding I found myself working more and rarely getting the opportunity to wear some of my favorite pieces from my closet. My hope is that Amy’s Vintage Closet can show other women that you don’t have to dress like a mannequin or buy everything name brand or full-price. True style comes from within and has no boundaries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So - what was it that really made you want to blog?</strong> I started this blog to create a healthy, adult outlet for myself. I often get asked what I am wearing or where I got something and having a visual database of my outfits helps a lot. Blogging is very much a positive release that I never knew I needed before. I look forward to blogging after a busy day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You have lived (literally) all over the world! Has this had an influence on your style?</strong> Absolutely! I often find a lot of my style inspiration from street style. I would definitely say this really took off for me while living in the Vancouver, BC area. I had never seen such eclectic individual style like Vancouver. San Diego isn’t a huge city on the fashion map in my opinion, but one thing I loved about living there was the laid back, effortlessly chic beach style. The women in San Diego have some of the best skin and hair I have ever seen. I felt like I really became obsessed with layering there. With temperatures in the mid 60’s &amp; 70’s everyday, there’s always a need for a few layered pieces. I have lived in Phoenix for a good portion of my adult life. It has been very fun to watch the fashion scene here grow and develop. One thing that Phoenix specifically has is store access. The city is conveniently set up for shopping. You can pretty much find anything you’re looking when shopping in Phoenix.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us: what was (or is!) your favorite place to live?</strong> My favorite place to live is Phoenix. My life is very much established here and I do not see myself moving anytime soon. I am such a sun lover. If I could lay out in the sun, by the pool everyday I would (obviously with sunscreen). Most cities have 2-3 months of good weather where we have about 8 months of heaven. The summers are rough on everyone, but I will take the heat over snow any day. I also am a sucker for 100degrees. It is my favorite temperature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> This is always hard for me to answer. My style is a direct reflection of my mood. Sometimes I feel very girly and sophisticated and other times all I want to wear is all black. I love a good pair of heels, but sneakers are also adding up quickly in my closet. Most of my daily outfits that I post on my Instagram are casual, laid back, wearable looks that I can put on at 7am and last until 8pm. Most of my outfit posts that you see on my blog are looks that I have time to put together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could wear one outfit everyday, what would it be?</strong> This one changes all the time, but I would have to say I am most comfortable in a Men’s Medium t-shirt, leggings/shorts, and sneakers/sandals. I love mixing an ordinary basic outfit with fun statement jewelry like a big necklace, multiple bracelet stack, and sunnies of course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What clothing or beauty item could you never live without?</strong> Clothing item, probably hats. Hats come in handy no matter what the season is and can add so much personality to a look. Beauty item I cannot live without would be my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. I am not a huge makeup fan so this is a perfect quick product that I throw on and run out the door when I don’t have time for makeup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a must-wear accessory or go to staple that you include in every outfit?</strong> Yes! I have a few vintage &amp; monogrammed necklaces that I wear almost every day. Some of them are new in the rotation and others have been passed down to me from family members. I am sucker for anything monogrammed. I also wear a ruby and diamond ring that my father gave to my mother 38 years ago when they first started dating that I wear everyday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging helped develop your styling skills?</strong> One of the best things about blogging is being involved in the blogging community. It is such an inspiring group of individuals doing their thing across the world. I get a lot of my inspiration from other bloggers. Street-style is so authentic &amp; raw which is the best thing about individual style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has blogging taught you?</strong> Blogging has taught me many things. You are literally putting yourself out there for the world to see, criticize, and comment on. That’s a very intimidating task. I feel like it has made my skin a little tougher, stretched my comfort zone further and helped encourage my self-confidence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> Have a goal and a purpose from the start. I think it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of other people who are trying to do what you’re doing, but that’s the beauty of it. There is room for everyone in the fashion blogging world. That being said, you really should try to strive to be original and authentic in all that you do. Try not to compare what you’re doing to someone else. Comparison kills passion and without passion whatever you’re doing is essentially useless.</p>\n"

She is passionate about architecture and about giving readers an exclusive look at the treasures within her closet. We chatted with this busy beauty to spot her unique blogger quirks. Learn more about Carolina and The French Fries with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the name “The French Fries”? It’s so different from other fashion blog names - it really stands out! (We love it!)</strong> Thank you so much! So… a lot of you ask me that question, and I smile and have no better answer than this: I just love french fries!</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, Carolina, how long have you been blogging for?</strong> One year and a half now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you start? Was it your passion for style and fashion, or something else?</strong> Yup. I created The French Fries on a summer afternoon between French fries and sodas. I start publishing because I just love clothes, fabrics, prints, colors… I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, and some amazing people helped me out to start!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you study fashion in university/college?</strong> No, I’m an architect, I finished my master last November.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I’m a creative type. I like mixing stuff, but with a classic vibe. I think the best adjective is eclectic</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time? If not, how frequently do you post blog entries on The French Fries?</strong> No, I have a normal job, I work on a studio, so I try to post as much as I can. Normally 20 posts per month, more or less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite season: Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter?</strong> Summer for sure. I need sun and shorts in my life. I’m a beach girl.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Florals or stripes?</strong> Floral with stripes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coffee or tea?</strong> I really don’t like coffee (at all!) Tea!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you started The French Fries, what would it be, and why?</strong> I just would have had more patience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your hair is so long and beautiful! What’s your secret?</strong> I really don’t have any. Do you believe that I receive e-mails asking me that? And when that happens, I just call my mom and dad I say thank you! Ahah really, I just use a normal shampoo (Pantene pro-v) and a blow dry, I don’t use anything else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend was about to launch a blog and she asked you for just one insider tip, what would you say?</strong> A lot of patience, and a no-stress attitude. And always remember why you have a blog, your passions, and goals.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Glam Latte</strong> is a style/fashion blog curated by <strong>Jamie Walsh</strong>. Based out of Los Angeles, California, Jamie uses Glam Latte (“fashion inspiration from the city of angels”) to showcase her personal style and favorite trends. She loves the color blue, prefers leopard over zebra (print), opts for stripes over polkadots, takes her coffee with coconut milk and Stevia, and absolutely adores her blogger friends (they do brunch!). Meet Jamie of Glam Latte with Blogspotter below!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Glam Latte sounds so delicious! We love the name, how did you come up with it?</strong> Coffee and Fashion are my two loves and long before blogging existed, I would curl up with a cup of coffee and read my favorite fashion magazines to get inspiration. My blog became a physical manifestation of that and so the name seemed fitting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to start blogging, and how long have you been blogging for?</strong> I started blogging in 2009 after a breakup. I realized I had lost a bit a bit of myself in the relationship and I wanted to start focusing on me. What did I want? What did I love? The blog was a great way to find my voice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You love coffee, so we must ask: how do you take it? Black, milk, cream, sugar?</strong> I always used to drink my coffee with half and half and Splenda, but I developed a lactose allergy and now I use almond or coconut milk and Stevia. I’m really health conscious!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory in your wardrobe - something you try and incorporate into every outfit?</strong> I think an outfit isn’t an outfit without a handbag. I love a special handbag so that’s also the thing I splurge on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you network/make friends with other bloggers and brands?</strong> I have awesome blogger friends. I’ve met most of them at events, but in the beginning there weren’t many of those. When I started blogging there weren’t nearly as many bloggers as there are today and so I was very isolated. I would search for bloggers who were local and reach out to see if they wanted to have brunch. That’s how I met my blogger bestie.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your pictures are just fab! Who takes your photos for you - and what kind of camera do you use?</strong> Thanks! For many years my good friend Patti Anglin has taken my pictures. It was a great way for her to work on her photography and me to build my blog. Last December my boyfriend got me a Canon T3i so I could be a bit more independent. Patti still takes my pictures, but now my boyfriend does when she’s not available or if we’re traveling. I also have a tripod and a remote just in case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you get inspiration on a daily basis? Do you have any favorite blogs?</strong> Inspiration comes from everywhere, the weather, my mood, a new pair of shoes I want to style. I do have a few favorite blogs, like Le Catch and Because I’m Addicted, but if I’m being honest, I really don’t have time to look at them often. Blogging keeps me so busy, and I’m also in grad school getting my broadcast journalism degree.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much time do you put into a blog post, from start to finish?</strong> Well it depends on the post, but I’d say about 4-5 hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s discuss social media. Do you find that it’s something that really impacts your viewership and fanbase?</strong> Yes, 100%. Social media is an extension of your blog and it’s also your marketing tool. It’s the best way to draw people into that days post if they weren’t otherwise planning on stopping by. I know for me, I could be having a super busy day, but if I see something that catches my eye, I will probably take the time to check it out. It’s also a way to connect with your readers directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Favorite color?</strong> Blue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! You only have time for one - manicure or pedicure?</strong> Mani. You can always throw on a close toed bootie, even in the summer with shorts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite social media platform? Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or Instagram - and why?</strong> Definitely Instagram. I am a really creative person and Instagram allows you to be creative, while still being social.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leopard print or zebra print?</strong> Leopard. Always and forever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Black and white stripes or polkadots?</strong> Stripes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see Glam Latte in 5 years?</strong> I see it being much more video oriented. I want to take my love for fashion and blogging and turn it into a broadcasted experience. I am working on that slowly and creating content on Youtube while getting my degree in broadcast journalism. It’s all part of my master plan!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you didn’t expect to learn?</strong> I learned how to create HTML code. I am by no means a computer nerd, but when you are a blogger and you need to create something and don’t have several thousand dollars to pay someone, you have to figure it out yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to offer a rising blogger one piece of advice, what would it be and why?</strong> Blogging isn’t going to make you rich. It’s like having a full time job that doesn’t pay. If you don’t love every second of it, if you don’t get some personal payoff from doing it, pour your energy into something else. Free clothes don’t pay the bills and making money at blogging means you need to have a following that takes YEARS to build. But if you already know you really want to do it, make sure you find what makes you unique. Why should people come to your blog everyday? I always ask myself, why you?</p>\n"

Learn more about Christine and xo Christine Marie by getting to know her with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your semi-self titled blog, “xo Christine Marie”.</strong> xo Christine Marie is style blog where I showcase anything from work attire, causal comfy everyday outfits to weekend date night ensembles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you first start blogging?</strong> I began blogging in September 2012 and it’s crazy to think about how much my blog has changed in that short year and a half. It began as a teacher inspired blog where I would post my work outfits along side teacher crafts. After a cross-country move, career change, and learning more about my audience it has evolved into a style blog of all sorts. I am so proud of the direction it has taken and can’t help but cringe a little when I look back to those first few posts. The thought of deleting some of the most embarrassing ones has definitely crossed my mind but it’s a good reminder of how much my blog has grown and matured.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was it that made you want to launch xo Christine Marie?</strong> I started my obsession with the blogosphere when I relocated for my first teaching position. I moved 4 hours from my parents to a town I didn’t know a soul for a job where I didn’t know anyone. I filled my free time with shopping and catching up on blogs. After a year of regular blog reading and many teachers at my school inquiring about my outfits and jewelry I started mulling around the idea of starting a blog of my own. After months of reading blogging books, nervous thoughts of people critics, and numerous design ideas I finally had the courage to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your style! It’s so girly and feminine, yet very professional. How would you self-describe your style, in a few words?</strong> My favorite thing about fashion is its versatility. Everyday I can be something different. Some days I feel like throwing on a biker jacket and studded heels, the next a J Crew skirt and cardigan and by the weekend I am all about cut off shorts and a flower in my hair. To sum up my everyday style I would say conservative with a touch of beach inspired casual.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one piece in your wardrobe that you can’t live without?</strong> It has to be a good skinny jean. My body type is far from a model’s, I’m not stick thin and I measure up at only 5’3! So when you finally find that pair that fits like a glove it’s as if the clouds have parted and angels sing. Let’s be honest, a good fitting jean completes any look.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> The older I get the more I realize it’s all about the hunt. I prefer browsing the Internet, shopping at vintage stores, or paroozing the never-ending rows at TJ Maxx than sticking to one particular store. When you read my blog you know I am a self proclaimed Maxxinista. My high school self, who was a strictly a labels girl would cringe at that last statement. The older I get the less I care for labels and the more thrive off the awesome find. Maybe it’s because I am shopping with my own money now? But I’ll just credit it to the fact I am more ‘mature’!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk about social media. Do you find that social media has played a very important role in the growth of xo Christine Marie?</strong> Social media has been a huge part of my growth. Being that I blog about fashion, pictures are a crucial aspect in drawing readers to my page. Which in turn has made me obsessed with Instagram and Pinterest. Both have been my biggest platforms in showcasing my outfits. I still find it crazy when I scroll through the popular page of pinterest and come across pictures of myself. Not to mention when I spot one with thousands of pins, I think ‘wow that many people enjoyed what I put together’!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your logo is so cute! Did you design it yourself? How did you come up with the idea for it? (we love the hanger!)</strong> Thank you! As I mentioned before I went through quite a few design options when first brainstorming the idea of my own blog. Jenn from Hello, Brio Studio designed my first layout. After a few months of blogging I contacted Jenn a second time when I was more comfortable with the direction my blog was going. I knew I wanted something sleek and simple. My boyfriend is an amazing artist and I told him I wanted something elegant and exampled the hanger idea and voila, he delivered! Thanks to Jenn I was able to make it come alive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are you feeling about the statement piece trend? Do you prefer one chunky piece of jewelry, or lots of dainty pieces?</strong> Wow, do I have to pick just one? My jewelry collection is larger than I would like to admit and I was suckered right into the statement jewelry trend. I own a statement piece in just about every shape and color. Just recently I have become Etsy obsessed (if there was an Etsy Addicts Anonymous I would be first in line) and I have been strictly buying dainty layering pieces. But my absolute favorite has been a simple outfit, a statement piece and some long layered dainty pieces; best of both worlds!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? They’re beauty-full!</strong> Thank you! My awesome and supportive boyfriend takes all of my pictures. Some days I have to bribe him with some chocolate or a beer when it’s a football Sunday and I have to a deadline to meet but he is such an important part of my blog. His help and support has really made it what it is today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Red or pink?</strong> Red all the way! Nothing beats a good red lip or flirty red pump.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Gold finish or silver finish?</strong> Easy, without a doubt, gold. Sometimes I need to remind myself of all the great silver pieces I own because I tend to always gravitate towards my gold pieces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The most rewarding component of blogging has been the followers and fellow bloggers I’ve met. The blogosphere has such a sense of community with so many uplifting people. I have made some great friends through this competitive blogging world whom I now know on a personal level. Sometimes I have to take a step back and giggle when I am out with fellow bloggers and think about how I never would have met them if it weren’t for taking that leap of faith in starting my own blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you started xo Christine Marie?</strong> The coolest thing was when I received an email from something simply telling me they were a ‘fan’. I thought “I have fans?!”, “People actually look forward to my next post?” They may be my only ‘fan’, aside from my mom, but it’s pretty cool knowing I have at least one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Teal! I’m a beach girl tried and true and you can find little pops of teal in my wardrobe, jewelry, apartment and even my blog design. Sometimes I have to tell myself “Christine, you don’t need that 10th teal necklace!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of must-have advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be?</strong> It may sound silly because I’ve read it in books and people are always saying it but that’s because it’s true – you have to be yourself. But I will add a second part to that, take your time. When I first began my blog I tried to be very ‘by the book’. I have a Masters degree and am quite the perfectionist in my everyday life so my blog has been no different. But after a year of blogging I had to take a step back and remind myself why I blog. To share my story, my clothes, and what I love. I use to rush to put together an outfit just because ‘I hadn’t posted in a few days’ or think ‘everyone is posting holiday trends so I should probably get on that too’ but that has since changed. Now that I have slowed down I think my posts have become richer, my outfits are more true to what I want to represent and I am much happier with the final product. It’s about having fun!</p>\n"

She hails from Georgia (a good ‘ole southern gal!), but currently resides in the Los Angeles area with her husband. Bubbly and eager, this full-time blogger confidently learns something from every move (good or bad) that she makes. Jessie adores pink, gushes over pearls, and her prefers her own take on style over others’ opinions, which we must admit - is oh-so-American-amazing. Sassy and fabulous, Jessie is the totally the next “It Girl”. See for yourself!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We recently came across Blush and Blonde and fell in love. It’s so American, graced by an American beauty! Tell us a little about your blog and the concept behind it.</strong> Gosh now I’m literally blushing! Thanks y’all! I started Blush and Blonde as a way to express myself and have a space of my own, so to speak. As an Army wife, my time and decisions are never really my own… There’s very little that I get to control in terms of where I live and what I do professionally. My childhood dreams of moving to NYC to work in fashion were no longer realistic, so I had to make my own creative fashion outlet! It’s already been more rewarding than I could have imagined, it takes real entrepreneurial spirit and being able to directly see the fruits of your labor is immensely gratifying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> Not long! I finally got the courage to start it at the end of 2013, although I’d been playing with the idea for quite a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you know it was the right time to launch your blog? Did you just go with a gut instinct, or had you gathered a little experience through other creative outlets first?</strong> I just went for it and jumped in with both feet. It’’s very much been a learn-as-I-go process. No guts no glory!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did you get the name “Blush and Blonde” from?</strong> I played around with name ideas for a while. I literally just wandered around the house saying random words that described me/my style aloud. Blush is my favorite color and my blonde hair is my trademark (which can be both good and bad!). I liked the alliteration of the two so I immediately checked to see if the domain name and social media handles were available. Luckily the name Blush and Blonde hadn’t been taken anywhere so I knew it was perfect! I’m the kind of person that just couldn’t stand to have different variations of it or random numbers added… I’m kind of OCD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> There are a lot of words that I would use to describe my personal style… Classic, modest, preppy, generally understated. When I get dressed I like to feel ladylike. Despite what people say, you often DO judge a book by its cover. I would rather my cover read Gone With the Wind than Fifty Shades of Grey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite brand?</strong> Just one? Oh gosh. Probably Lilly Pulitzer. The attention to detail never ceases to amaze me and I’ve never put on a Lilly that didn’t fit like a glove.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are you from originally? You’re in California now, do you find that being in California has influenced your personal style drastically from what it was?</strong> My family is originally from the South and when I was young I spent a lot of time in both California and Georgia. I went to college in the San Francisco Bay Area, but moved back to Georgia right after graduating. I think that wherever I am, my personal style stays the same. I know what I like and I know what I feel good in. Sometimes I stick out like a sore thumb here in California, but that’s ok by me because I feel confident in what I wear. I was working in the news for a while, and I remember one day I came into work and one of my coworkers bluntly announced that my outfit made me look like a Southern housewife. To this day I’m really not sure if that was meant as a compliment or an insult, but it’s fine by me either way! To me, it was a compliment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time? If not, do you have any times on part-time blogging and time management?</strong> Yes, I blog full-time. I had no idea that it really was such a full-time pursuit before I began. On most days, I spend way longer than a 9 to 5 period on my blog. Between creating content, planning, managing social media, interacting with readers and working with or reaching out to brands, I’m swamped! Time management has definitely been a struggle. The solution for me has been to write everything down in a planner and prioritize. Never underestimate the power of a good list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much time do you typically allot to complete a blog post? (From start to finish, including “thinking”, photography, editing, and content writing)</strong> The entire process of a single blog post usually takes a few days, sometimes longer. For me, it’s a little bit harder because my husband takes my pictures and his schedule is always changing. On average I’d say it takes 4 days. Planning and writing are the easiest for me, photography and editing are always time consuming. It’s always good to have some other ideas up your sleeve that don’t involve your own pictures or outfits. Sometimes I’ll do wish lists, collages, or good recipes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Pink or red?</strong> Pink, duh! Is that even a question?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Diamonds or pearls?</strong> Pearls! But I’ll never say no to diamonds either.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Large floral print or jumbo polkadot print?</strong> Oooh this one’s a little harder. Depends on my mood, but I’d probably be more likely to go with the floral.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> That I can do a lot! A blog is essentially a publication, and I’m the writer, editor, creative director, model, photographer, chef, and IT support all rolled into one. I didn’t know I could do any of those things, let alone all of them! It’s very motivational.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photographs for you? What camera do you use?</strong> My sweet husband takes my pictures! But bless his heart, he is a soldier and NOT a photographer! I always have this artistic vision in my head that he has a bit of a hard time translating. I love him to death for all the time and patience he’s spent helping me though. My next step is to reach out to some local photographers who might be willing to shoot with me in exchange for exposure on the blog. I have a Nikon D3200, which is a great DSLR for a decent price. I think that quality images are something that sets really good blogs apart, so a good camera is an important investment. I’ve learned that the secret is in the lens though! The quality of your image will often depend on whether or not you have the correct lens for what you’re shooting. I currently have the standard 18-55mm telephoto lens and a 50mm prime lens, which are great to start with. My next purchase will be the 135mm, which should produce better full-body fashion shots. I would advise other new bloggers to take some time to study and learn about photography, you’ll be glad you did!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to offer advice to an aspiring blogger that you wish you had received, what would it be?</strong> The advice I’d give to a new fashion blogger is the same advice I’d give to anyone: stop worrying about what you think people want to see. Stop worrying about what someone else says is “trendy.” You run your own blog… your style IS the “it” style here. The readers who like your style and are inspired by it will find you and they’ll be faithful readers as long as you stay true to what you actually believe.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Smart and stylish, Aleksandra Panic</strong> of <strong>SashaDoll Fashion Closet</strong> started her blog as a way of sharing fashionable bargains with her readers. A financial guru with no prior sartorial experience, she was camera shy at first, but has now blossomed into a style pro. She prefers espresso over cappuccinos and lattes, loves color (jewel tone obsessed!), and cherishes the conversations she’s had with fellow “famous” bloggers. Meet the Toronto based beauty with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about SashaDoll Fashion Closet - where did the name come from?</strong> My nickname in my language is Sasha and my family calls me doll. So I thought it sounded cute SashaDoll. Then I just played around with words and came up with SashaDoll Fashion Closet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I started in June of 2013. Still fairly a newbie!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you make the decision to launch your own blog? Did you just have an “ahha” moment, or did something else motivate you to take the leap?</strong> I have been thinking about it for a long time. I love fashion blogs and always wanted to have one of my own. I often get stopped on the street by girls and women to ask me where I got something or to compliment me. I love sharing my cheap finds (read inexpensive not cheap looking) with everyone. I thought blogging about it would also be a great way to do that. If nothing, at least I will have a diary of outfits in case I have one of those days when I don’t have any inspiration of what to wear, haha. Once I verbalized it out loud, it had to happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You work in the financial industry but you pose like a pro! Do you have any prior fashion industry experience?</strong> None at all. But thank you for the compliment. If you look at my pictures in the beginning you will notice that I wore a lot of sunglasses, I was very shy and uncomfortable in front of the camera (even though it is mostly my husband taking pictures), but over time I worked through my fears and got better at it. Once you learn to relax in front of the camera you become yourself, which is the most beautiful you. You just have to find poses that work for your body shape. Practicing in front of mirror helps but camera sees you differently through the lens. So practice by taking pictures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You move around a lot. Where are you from originally? Do you find a lot of inspiration in your hometown?</strong> I was born in Sarajevo. When the war started I moved and lived in Belgrade, Serbia. I also moved several times in Canada too and now finally (I hope), I am settled in Toronto. I definitely think that my style is influenced by where I am from. I get a lot of feminine inspiration from Serbia (or region in general). Being dressed up at any time of the day, wearing heels even in icy weather, I think comes from my roots. The casual, more urban vibe a lot of my outfits have, is definitely influenced by the culture and my life in Canada. I believe it to be a great mix.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You wear color so well. Any tips for pulling off brights/neons?</strong> Make sure you pick the shade that works for your skin tone. There may be different shades of neon pink, or yellow, or any other neon colour out there, and you can find the one right for you. If you really don’t feel that any of them go very well with your skin tone, then wear it away from your face. Wear the colour in skirts, pants, accessories. Most people look great in bright colours. We just have to get over the fear that we may stand out too much. You look brighter and happier in happy colours and for sure you leave others feeling that way too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory in your closet?</strong> It used to be my XL hoop earrings. Now I am not sure. Do shoes count?</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Who is your favorite designer?</strong> Shoes: Sophia Webster. Clothes: Dolce &amp; Gabbana (especially their last collection) and Zara. I have also fallen in love with Peter Pilotto! Amazing prints and shapes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jewel tones or neutrals?</strong> I love colour so jewel tones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Black or navy?</strong> Oh that’s hard. I’ll go with black.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latte or cappuccino?</strong> Espresso, haha! Ok, cappuccino it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on blazers?</strong> I am a huge fan. Even though I have a hard time finding ones that fit my body shape, I love them. You can dress them up or down, wear them over dresses. They are one of those pieces of clothing in your closet that will be used over and over again. It is a must for any woman. You should have at least three: at least one black one, one in either navy, gray, white or tan colour (second neutral) and one in a bright colour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are you feeling about the “Statement Piece” (jewelry) trend?</strong> I love jewellery in general. You can spruce up any outfit by adding one of those amazing statement necklaces or bracelets. In the summer especially, I love to wear a plain t-shirt, heels, jeans and to dress it up, I add statement necklace. If you don’t feel like dressing up too much but still want to look like you put some effort into it, this is a great way to do it. Also, if you are not feeling great about your body and want the attention at your face, what a better way to do it then to put on some great earrings or a necklace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find that social media has been an important factor with respect to your blog’s growth?</strong> I’m still learning about it. But I can definitely say that it is a huge part of being a blogger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging?</strong> There has to be a few. Definitely being approached for collaboration is a compliment, but receiving kind emails and notes from people all over the world, is more important. I also got to speak (email) with some of my favourite bloggers who have answered many of my questions when I was just starting. It was great to see that someone famous who receives hundreds of emails and messages daily, took the time to answer my questions and send me off with kind words into the blogosphere.</p>\n"

If sophisticated fashion with a side of good eats is your cup of sweet tea, Turquoise and Teale is for you. Learn more about the lovely lady behind it through her insightful responses with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Turquoise and Teale is part of the Southern Blog Society. How does southern style play a big part in your posts?</strong> Southern style has always been a part of my life. Growing up in Georgia you’re surrounded by quintessential southern charm; bright colors, bold prints, beautiful oak trees and some of the most welcoming people you’ll ever meet. My posts are a mixture of all my favorite things: classic styles, beautiful images and food that you can throw together for anything from a Sunday brunch to an al fresco dinner party.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You share not only personal style, but also cooking, travel, and other interesting snapshots of your life. What made you want to cover so much in your blog?</strong> Before I started Turquoise &amp; Teale I found myself drawn to blogs that covered a variety of things they were passionate about. The writing seems to connect most with me when bloggers are sharing what they love and providing an assortment of posts. What better way to represent myself than include a little of everything that I love? Think of it as a one-stop-shop! You can find new beauty products, a dessert recipe and a splash of fashion all in one place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you manage bouncing around from Atlanta, Georgia to Charleston, South Carolina to Saint Louis, Missouri?</strong> Staying organized while traveling is key. It’s embarrassing how much I rely on a calendar to keep me on top of events/deadlines/meetings, but it’s what works. Safe to say there’s rarely a dull moment when you’re always on the go!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You probably have your packing and travel style down pat. Tell us about your process.</strong> If I was ever on a TV show and asked my special talent, it would easily be packing a carry-on, TSA approved suitcase in under 5 minutes. My foolproof method starts with lining the suitcase sides with shoes and roll everything else that’s going in. Start with the heaviest items (jeans, jackets) on the bottom and work your way to lighter fabrics. Store jewelry in a clutch and always have a light scarf with you — you’re bound to need it for something!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give us a brief description of your personal style.</strong> My personal style could best be described as classic and preppy with a modern twist. I love finding pieces that can be worn running around town during the day, but also could be dressed up for drinks at night. For accessories I like to keep things simple. I’ll find a delicate gold necklace, bangles and a great watch and wear them non-stop; those are the pieces to invest in and never go out of style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You mention that the best color combination is navy and white. How did you come to this conclusion?</strong> For me a combination of navy and white instantly reminds me of something fresh yet bold. I haven’t met a single person that doesn’t look good in those two colors… it’s magic and flatters everyone! To me, it’s timeless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any other color or texture combinations that are close to your heart?</strong> As a graduate of University of Georgia, black and red will always remain close to my heart. Come Saturdays in the fall, there’s a 99% chance I’m wearing the combo and cheering on the bulldogs with a cocktail in hand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Some of my favorite places to shop are the little tucked away stores that are off the beaten path. Charleston has some amazing shops scattered around the downtown peninsula and I love finding little local made treasures. For clothing, I could easily live in J.Crew, Zara and Shopbop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What items in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My engagement ring, a comfortable and chic pair of flats and a great leather bag that withstands the test of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you hunt for the clothing and products that you are “currently loving”?</strong> For my “Currently Loving” series, I start out by browsing the sites that I normally visit on my own. If there’s a new product that I’m using and loving, that goes into the mix too! I aim to keep a mix of price ranges in the post so there’s a little something for everyone. Finding something that catches your eye and realizing it’s affordable, that’s what I love searching for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who or what is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> My main source of inspiration is all around me. I’m constantly being inspired by magazines, other bloggers and people walking down the street.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start blogging in the beginning?</strong> In the beginning I started blogging to keep my family and friends in the loop when I moved away to Charleston, SC. They were always asking for new recipes and favorite new finds, so I combined it all into one easy spot for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> I’ve absolutely loved blogging and all the opportunities it’s given me. I’ve met some wonderful friends while traveling, learned tips and tricks from readers around the world and created an online scrapbook of sorts that lets me relive some of my favorite moments along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> The main message that I would hope to convey to readers is that I’m a down to earth, mid-twenty year old girl that loves writing and sharing what I’m passionate about. I’m not perfect, life’s not perfect, but I love expressing myself through my blog and having the readers to follow along wherever life takes me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice or personal anecdotes for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Write about what excites you, support other bloggers and never compare yourself. Don’t feel like you have to post every day. Skip a Wednesday post if it means spending extra time with your girlfriends at happy hour or enjoying the company of family. Take time to really live life and the joy will show through in your writing.</p>\n"

It is also a record of the eclectic personal style of <strong>Sally-Jean White</strong>. One day she might take inspiration from the 50s and next she’ll borrow from the boys. When it comes to designers, though, she believes in girl power, citing Rebecca Minkoff as a favorite. Keep up with Sallie’s ever-changing looks and learn more about her with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about Antiques &amp; Coffee.</strong> Antiques &amp; Coffee is just a little ol’ blog I started to share my love of fashion, all things vintage and DIY projects. I always look to awesome antique pieces and loads of coffee to stay inspired… See what I did there?</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you launch Antiques &amp; Coffee, and how long have you been blogging for?</strong> Antiques &amp; Coffee originally began about 2 years ago, but I didn’t begin to actively blog till almost a year ago when I discovered that it’s such a great way to express myself creatively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would definitely describe my personal style as eclectic. One day I want to dress like I live in the ’50s and another day I may want to dress like a girl who stole her boyfriend’s clothes (which I actually do!) I’ve always felt that if you want to wear something, you should wear it and rock it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You must love coffee… considering it’s half of the name of your blog! So we must ask: how do you take it? Black, cream, milk, sugar…</strong> Coffee is life! Ha-ha! I usually take my coffee with hazelnut creamer and sugar, but I love to mix it up and use coconut oil as a sweetener! Yum!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your take on social media? How has social media generally helped with the branding of your blog?</strong> Social media has really allowed me to get my blog out there. While I’m still consistently working to grow A &amp; C, social media is helping me to share my blog and make new friends in the blogosphere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find that social media is the reason for a lot of your traffic, or is your traffic driven from other bloggers/organically?</strong> I’d probably have to say that the blogger community has really welcomed me with open arms. For such a long time, other bloggers were my only source of traffic because I never shared my blog for fear of seeming “braggy”, #introvertproblems. Yet now that I’ve come out of my shell, I’d definitely say that social media is such a good way to network and grow your traffic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Oh my, well, if I could afford to… I would say Fossil. Gorgeous watches, cute handbags and classic clothes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Generally speaking, what’s your favorite thing about blogging?</strong> Being someone who hates to take directions when it comes to creativity (I hated art classes in school) the freedom of blogging about whatever you want is my favorite thing by far. I can blog about DIY beauty products one day and a rad new thrift shop the next. With blogging, the possibilities are endless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Spicy or sweet?</strong> Spicy, hands down! Major chips and salsa addict over here!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are your 3 favorite designers?</strong> Rebecca Minkoff, Kate Spade, and Victoria Beckham! Girl power!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you study fashion as an undergrad? If not, how are you able to implement what you studied as an undergrad into the operation/content of your blog?</strong> I’m actually still an undergrad working toward my B.S. in Business Management (only 3 more months!) Essentially, I’ve learned how to really manage my blog and I work toward treating it like my own business. One day, I hope to channel everything I’ve learned into a real business that incorporates things I love!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite social media platform? For personal and business purposes, which is it and why?</strong> I’d have to say Instagram is my favorite. I think it really let’s you see people’s creative sides and who doesn’t love a good selfie?</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Tell us one really cool thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging.</strong> This! My journey with blogging has just begun but as I become more and more involved with the blogging community, I love it even more than before! Things like this help me to remember that even though it can get hectic, it’s still so fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had to offer one piece of essential advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be?</strong> Just keep blogging! In the beginning, you may think to yourself, “this stuff I’m making/writing/doing isn’t good!” but everyone sucks at first and you’ll get better! When it comes to blogging, I try to live by these two quotes: “Don’t compare your beginning to someone else’s middle” and “The expert in anything was once a beginner.” If you keep to it, you won’t regret it!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Hannah Hawkshaw</strong> of <strong>Hawk Eye View</strong> may be the most self-confident, ambitious, and sophisticated 16-year-old we’ve ever chatted with. It’s evident that she’s absolutely fearless, (her advice to a newbie blogger: “don’t be frightened – fear nothing”) which we find is the most admirable trait about her. Along with blogging at Hawk Eye View, (which, by the way, she launched when she was a mere 13 years old) she’s in the process of developing a music career as a <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/HannahHawkshaw\">singer/songwriter</a>. She loves Louis Vuitton, confesses that if she had $1,500 to blow - it’d be on a Chanel 2.55 Classic Flap Bag, and adores pink. We’re not sure what they’re putting in the water in Ireland - but whatever it is, we would like some of it! Meet Hannah Hawkshaw of Hawk Eye View with Blogspotter today - you do not want to miss her, now or in the future.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You hail from Ireland, your hair is beautiful, and we love the name of your blog. Tell us a little bit about yourself.</strong> Thank you so much! Well… I’m a 16 year old fashion blogger born in Manchester, but currently living in Dublin, Ireland. I also happen to be a <a href=\"http://Soundcloud.com/HannahHawkshaw\">singer/songwriter</a>, with music being my first love. I’m crazy in love with the fashion industry and hope to combine my two loves into a career for myself in the near future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the weather like in Ireland right now?</strong> To be honest, it’s absolutely horrible! I’m not a fan of the Irish climate at the moment, it’s very rainy and grey. However, Dublin hasn’t been as bad weather-wise as other parts of the country so I’m trying to keep my spirits high by keeping a smile on my face!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you decide to launch Hawk Eye View? How long have you been blogging for?</strong> It was a very spur-of-the-moment decision, actually. I came across blogging during a very difficult time in my life when I was just 13 and suffering with long term illness and blogging soon became the perfect outlet for me. I had no idea that it would become such a monumental part of my life and aid my recovery as it did! I established my blog in late 2010, but have only been blogging seriously since just last year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your celebrity doppelganger is Amy Adams - in some of your photos you look like you could be twins! Do you get this a lot?</strong> Really?! Wow, thank you! I’ve actually never gotten that before, but I’m so flattered that you think that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the most awesome experience you’ve had that was only possible because of your blog.</strong> Hmm, that’s a tough one, blogging has led me to so many wonderful opportunities. However, recently, I was invited over to Berlin for The STYLIGHT Fashion Blogger Awards which was huge for me. I got to meet so many influential people and some of my favourite bloggers including Chiara Ferragni and Kristina Bazan. This was such an awesome experience and definitely my favourite so far!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong> I read so many blogs on a daily basis that it’s so hard to list them all. However, I really love Kayture. Kristina Bazan has such a chic sense of style that is quite in line with mine, and the fact that she also started her blog in her teens makes her that much more relatable to me, so her blog is always at the top of my list. I’m also an avid reader of BeFassy.net and Viva Luxury.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does Irish culture influence your style?</strong> The Irish weather in particular greatly influences my style. When the weather is as dull and cold as it has been these past few weeks, it’s tough not to forget about style and just through on a warm knit and sweat pants. It really challenges me on a daily basis, to look good whilst also keeping warm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer?</strong> Louis Vuitton. I’ve been a lover of the brand for as long as I can remember, investing in my first Speedy at the tender age of 13. It epitomizes elegance and grace and is a brand which I have forever been in awe of. I also strongly admire Chanel’s classic styles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory - something that you wear everyday?</strong> I have a few favourite pieces, but not ones I necessarily wear everyday. I like to mix things up on a daily basis but in general, my favourite piece would be my beloved Louis Vuitton Speedy 35. It’s a practical piece, yet one that dresses up any outfit effortlessly and is perfect for every occasion. I’m also currently loving my Daniel Wellington Classic Sheffield Lady watch. It’s such a timeless piece!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would describe my style as being classic and elegant, yet unafraid of taking a risk. I like to keep things simple whilst also challenging myself to push my own boundaries and to play with different styles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had $1,500 to spend on a wardrobe piece, what would you spend it on? (and why!)</strong> That’s easy – a Chanel 2.55 Classic Flap Bag. I have been lusting over this timeless piece for as long as I can remember!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what kind of camera do you use?</strong> My photographer also happens to be my mother, playing two significant roles in my life, however, I also act as photographer on occasions where I am not the subject of the photo. We use a Nikon D3100 which we find to be easy-to-use and practical for events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pearl studs or diamond studs?</strong> This girl could never choose between pearls and diamonds! After all, if one was to pick, it limits the possibilities…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite color?</strong> Pink, definitely pink. I’m such a girly-girl, actually, I’m a real Elle Woods at heart. The funny thing is, I have very few pieces of pink clothing in my wardrobe, something I plan to rectify this summer!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding Hawk Eye View?</strong> Instagram would have to be my favourite social media platform. I definitely think it helps with branding, it’s a brilliant way of giving one’s followers more of an insight into your personal life. I love sharing more casual snaps with my followers and seeing other bloggers’ experiences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> Self-confidence. Before I started my blog, I had very low self-esteem. Even something as simple as shooting an outfit in public has been incredibly helpful to me on a personal level. As well as that, the feedback and support I have received has been amazing, and has encouraged me to have faith and believe more in myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Don’t be frightened – Fear nothing. I was absolutely terrified of what my peers would think of my blog. For the first year and a half, nobody but my immediate family knew it even existed - not even my best friends. However, when I eventually plucked up the courage to tell people about it, it was the best decision I have ever made, and the journey I have had since doing so has been better than I could have ever imagined. Worrying about what others will think will get you nowhere – but believing in yourself and your work will.</p>\n"

She knows how to keep in it the family: her husband and her 9-year old daughter take turns snapping the stunning photographs found on her blog. She loves Instagram (both personally and for the branding of Cara’s Cliché) and opts for pinstripes over solids (noting “when in doubt always opt for the unexpected details”). Meet the blogger behind Cara’s Cliché with Blogspotter today.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We love the name “Cara’s Cliche”, but we love the tagline “Start the Cliche, Don’t Become One” even more. How did you come up with both the name of your blog and the tagline - which came first?</strong> When I was trying to think of a name for my blog I wanted something that truly represented both my personality and my style. Everything seemed so similar to a blog that was already out there. My husband turned to me out of the blue one night and said “What about ‘Cara’s Cliche’, you have always had your own sense of style that you stay true to no matter what”. To be completely honest initially I wasn’t a fan, but the more I thought about it the more the name grew on me and I came to love it. The tagline just came to me after that. Both were my way of saying wear what you love despite what anybody else may think of it. Kind of like making “fetch” happen, there is always a way to make it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> Since January 2013, I can’t believe it has been over a year already!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re pretty active on Instagram and Twitter, what’s your favorite social media platform both personally and for Cara’s Cliche?</strong> Definitely Instagram. Being a mom I am all about capturing life through pictures, it goes by too quickly not to have a way to look back on it all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photos are stunning! Who takes your pictures for you?</strong> It started out for the first several months being only my husband. Emma came to me one night and asked if she could please try. The rest is history and now it’s about a 60/40 split between my daughter and husband. My daughter’s eye for photography at just 9 years old amazes me more and more every single day and my husband’s artistic side has always been one of the things I admire most about him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What kind of camera do you use? Do you edit all of your photos by yourself?</strong> I use a Nikon DSLR 5100 - I am still learning I do edit all of my photos by myself. Thank goodness for user friendly programs like Lightroom!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite designer right now?</strong> Preen. The prints and sophisticated lines get me season after season.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only shop one brand for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Chanel, hands down, that is if my wallet would allow of course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your style in 3 adjectives?</strong> Sophisticated, comfortable, fresh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite always-wear accessory?</strong> I truly can’t pick just one. I never take off my Michael Kors watch but can’t get enough of my Enlightened Goddess shark tooth necklace and citrine ring (her pieces are unique while still being incredibly versatile).</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! Pinstripe or solid seersucker blazer?</strong> Pinstripe! When in doubt always opt for the unexpected details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mint chocolate chip or strawberry ice cream?</strong> Mint chocolate chip, anything with chocolate and I am sold!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you network with other bloggers? Do you typically find that it’s easier to initiate conversation through your blog (comments) or through social media?</strong> Events are always a great way to network but between family life and my day job they are not always easy to make it to. Both Instagram and blog comments have helped me build lasting relationships. I have made so many unexpected and amazing friends through both avenues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you frequent any online resources/websites for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> I am going to kick myself later for admitting this but no. There are several blogs I love and make sure to check out day to day though!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> As corny as it may sound blogging has taught me that support comes from every angle. I have had so many readers email me and let me know how much they look forward to my posts and that I have inspired them in some way. That was definitely something I never expected but am so incredibly grateful for every single day!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to give one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be and why?</strong> Don’t abandon who you are or your own personal style because it’s what sets you apart!</p>\n"

She’s obsessed with glossy magazines (hello Elle, Vogue, Marie Claire, Harpers Bazaar, and Lucky!) and admits that the feminine modest characteristics of southern style (hey, southern charmer…) has rubbed off on her. She’ll take faux pearl studs over jewel studs in a heartbeat and never leaves home without her red lipstick. Meet Holly of My Scuttle with Blogspotter below.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>The name My Scuttle is so cute! What does it mean?</strong> Thank you! I used to not think it was cute when I was teenager but now I love it. I wish the name had some really deep, hidden meaning but it doesn’t, I’m not that cool. My aunt always called me Scuttle since I was little and it just stuck. Most people think I’m named after the bird from little mermaid but I didn’t even know that was the birds name until I was in my teens, so there is no relation there. Still at the age of 25 I am known as Scuttle, not Holly, in family circles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the blog. What made you start it, and how long have you been blogging for?</strong> Honestly, I kind of stumbled into my blog. I used to have an Etsy shop and I created the blog to help support and promote it. When I decided to close my shop, I didn’t know what to do with my blog because I really liked blogging. Going the fashion route was actually my husband’s idea. I have always loved fashion and personal style since I was old enough to dress myself but I didn’t know how to share that beyond just styling myself every day. So out of that desire to share my love of style and my love of blogging, My Scuttle the fashion blog was born. Now I blog about 80% about fashion, my first love, and then the remaining 20% is just my personal life and travels. I have been blogging for 2 years in March and I can’t imagine not doing it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re based out of Nashville, Tennessee. Does the south have a huge impact on your personal style?</strong> Hmmm, that’s a tricky question. I would love to say that the south hasn’t influenced my fashion but thats a lie. I have been born and raised in the south (Atlanta first, now Nashville) so I know that it has had to impact me some, but I am definitely do not have the stereotypical style that people think of when they think about the southern woman. Sure, I have cowboy boots and overalls but they aren’t my regular look - and they are never worn together! I don’t wear sun hats and tea-length dresses like the Hart of Dixie characters either. There is, though, a very feminine nature that many southern women possess. They tend to be a bit dressier in every day life and a bit more modest, I would say that side of the south has rubbed off on me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jewel studs or faux pearls?</strong> Faux pearls for sure!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What one word defines your personal style?</strong> Pizzazz</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hair up or hair down?</strong> Hair down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites/magazines do you read on a daily basis?</strong> I am an avid blog follower! There are so many great blogs that I love to follow and as much as I love fashion most of the blog I read are ironically food and décor blogs, some of my favorites are: French by Design, Thyme is Honey, Coco+Kelley and Amanda K. by the Bay. I do have two fashion bloggers that are my idols and I have a major blog crush on, they are Atlantic-Pacific and Cheetah is the New Black. There both just so chic and I love their blogs and style for very different reasons but they both inspire me so much. I am a magazine hoarder as well. I have a subscription to almost all of the top fashion magazine (Elle, Vogue, Marie Claire, Harpers Bazaar, Lucky). Its just one of my favorite down time activities. My husband plays video games, I read Vogue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I am a lot of Audrey Hepburn with just a dash of rock n’ roll thrown in. I am drawn to the very feminine pieces that consist of tailored feminine silhouettes, full skirts, cinched waists, big bows, glitter, midi/tea/mini length skirts – I love them all. I do have a streak in me that loves leather and fringe though, so I will pair a lot of leather studded vests or high-top sneakers with feminine pieces to bring more of an edge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you make your blog stand out?</strong> I am always true to my personal style and I am not willing to budge on that. My style is unique to me and that is what makes me stand out. It is an authenticity that you can’t fake. People who love to read blogs aren’t looking for anything that is showy or fake, they just want the truth from normal people like them, so that is what I do, but I deliver the truth all wrapped up in pink with a glittery bow on top because thats me. The more glitter the better!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has launching and maintaining your blog taught you? Have you had to overcome any obstacles?</strong> Hands down the biggest thing I have learned from launching my blog is that consistency is the greatest key to growing anything! Growth only comes through persistent maintenance. You can’t expect people to stay interested in what you are doing if you aren’t dependable. I have learned that that is so true in so many other areas of life. You can’t grow anything or have people trust in you if you can’t remain consistent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I would have immediately started blogging about fashion and never have done the Etsy shop. As well as I would have been consistent with my posting right off of the bat. Why? Because the Etsy shop was fun but fashion is my true calling. I would have been more consistent because it would have been a much better experience for my followers. I appreciate them so much and want them to always enjoy My Scuttle, so consist at the beginning would have been helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What clothing, beauty product or accessory could you never live without?</strong> Never leave home without red lipstick!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> The moment you start feeling down because you look at other blogs and compare yourself to them, stop looking at them! There are so many fabulous blogs out there but if you find that all you do is compare yourself to them and feel bad about yourself and your blog, stop yourself from reading them for a while and wait until your in a better place to follow along again. Your blog is meant to be something special and different from everyone else, so you can’t compare it to everyone else.</p>\n"

She works full-time in PR, which provides her with a unique outlook on blogging. She describes her style as “casual and easy” (she lives right by the beach in Santa Monica) and is excited about maxi dresses and long rompers this season. Meet the Cali girl behind Love and Ace with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your blog. What made you decide to launch Love and Ace, and what was it that really made you want begin blogging?</strong> I was freelancing at an e-commerce company and part of what I did was interview the artists and designers we featured in our newsletters. Everyone had such a unique story of how they got started, their creative processes and inspirations. I decided to start a blog that focused on sharing the stories of these designers. I mixed in my own outfit posts as time went along to spice up the content. That’s why I call my blog a semi-personal style blog – it’s a mix of my own personal style and interviews with designers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I started in the Summer of 2012 so about a year and a half now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong> I read so many blogs! But my daily go to’s are Who What Wear, Refinery29, Fashiontoast, Caroline’s Mode, The Window (Barney’s blog) and Oracle Fox.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you study fashion and/or style as an undergraduate? If not, how did you learn the ins-and-outs of the industry?</strong> I was actually a psychology major in college and I currently work in tech PR so completely the opposite of fashion! However, I’ve always had a passion for all things fashion. I followed a lot of personal style blogs before I decided to start one of my own. It’s definitely a “learn as you go” experience for me. I feel like I’ve learned so much from my first post but I also have so much more to learn. I use the Blogger platform, which is really easy and user friendly. From there I watched a lot of youtube tutorials on how to customize my blog, design a logo, create widgets, etc. I googled, a lot! Being in PR, although in the tech space, also helps since I get to see what it’s like from the other side and how to effectively approach brands and start a relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer?</strong> Amber Kekich-Purling, the designer of LA based AGAIN, has such an eye for texture and shapes. I’m also a huge fan of Odylene, another LA brand has the most gorgeous dreamy dresses. I was also just at fashion week and got to see the Mara Hoffman show, she’s incredible!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite trends this season?</strong> For Spring, I’m excited to wear maxi dresses and long rompers - super effortless. And I love anything in white!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory - something that you wear everyday?</strong> I have a few simple and rings stackable rings by Gorjana and Griffin that I wear everyday along with my wedding band.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I grew up right by the beach, in Santa Monica (and I still live here) so my style tends to be casual and easy – lots of shorts, comfy tees, jeans and summer dresses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your husband takes your photos for you - what kind of camera does he use?</strong> He uses a Cannon 5d mark II. I’m so thankful that he finds the time to snap photos for me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Black</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cupcakes or brownies?</strong> Brownies</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pistachio or mint chocolate chip ice cream?</strong> Mint chocolate chip!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with the growth of Love and Ace?</strong> Definitely Instagram I think it’s a great way to engage with the fashion community - whether that’s with other bloggers or brands. I think Instagram definitely helps with the grown of Love and Ace - I have discovered a lot of great blogs via Instagram and I’ve had people find me the same way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer a few words of wisdom to an aspiring blogger, what would they be?</strong> Be consistent with posting! I think it’s important to be able to post at least twice a week, readers don’t want to show up and see content from last week. And of course, be patient. Success doesn’t happen overnight but if you keep working hard it will definitely pay off!</p>\n"

Craving a creative outlet and cognizant of her passion for fashion, she launched Citrus &amp; Style just before starting high school. She prefers pink over orange, adores stripes (navy and white, please!), and deeply cherishes the friendships she’s made with other bloggers through Citrus &amp; Style. Get to know the Wisconsin-bred brunette beauty below - and trust us, she’s not going anywhere for a while!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Citrus &amp; Style is so juicy - and the colors on your blog reflect that! How did you come up with the name?</strong> To be honest, it was kind of a mistake! The word “citrus” was always kind of nostalgic and pretty to me but when I went to register the name, it was already taken. So instead, I opted to add “&amp; Style” and it has oddly been very fitting!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you start blogging?</strong> Believe it or not, I began blogging the summer before my freshman year of high school. I was craving a creative outlet and had always loved fashion and sharing my tips and tricks with others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We can’t believe you’re only in high school! It’s quite the accomplishment to have launched your own blog already. Where do you envision your blog in 3 years?</strong> Thank you so much! Blogging has helped me realize my love for collaborating with others and working with brands, so I hope that my blog with grow into a career for me. It has grown so much from where I started and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a big monogram fan! Tell us what you love most about monogrammed goods.</strong> I love how classic and personal monograms are. Adding your initials to an item makes it so unique and special.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you?</strong> It kind of depends on where I am but usually my fellow blogger friends do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any tips for balancing your school workload, extra curriculars, and blogging? You seem to have it down to a science!</strong> Well thank you! My life is pretty hectic but I would say that you definitely have to make time for the things you are passionate about. For me, I dedicate an hour to blogging everyday and even more time on the weekends. I schedule my posts ahead of time and keep an agenda (Sugar Paper ones are my favorite!) to plan my time out so I can manage it all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite blogs to visit for inspiration?</strong> I read so many but my favorites have to be A Piece of Toast, Design Darling and Lemon Stripes. They never fail to amaze me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pink or orange?</strong> Pink! I am crazy about both but prefer orange in smaller doses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stripes or plaid?</strong> Stripes for sure. Navy and white please!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shimmery gold or matte white?</strong> I am a white enthusiast because it’s so clean and crisp.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grapefruit or lemon?</strong> Such a hard choice ;) I love both – lemon juice is amazing in water and a sliced grapefruit with a sprinkle of sugar on top is the perfect snack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite item in your wardrobe? Why?</strong> I would have to say my chambray shirt because of its versatility. I wear it constantly throughout every season and it can be dressed up or down. Every girl definitely needs one of these in her closet!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one of the most exciting things that has happened to you since you launched Citrus &amp; Style?</strong> Although so many incredible things have come out of starting a blog, I would have to say the relationships I’ve developed are the most rewarding thing. Some of my best friends are people I’ve met through blogging and I can’t imagine my life without them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find that blogging on a frequent basis has improved your writing skills?</strong> Definitely. I’ve learned what my style of writing is and I truly think it has helped my English grade too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Words of wisdom from you to another high-schooler: What’s one piece of essential advice you’d give a fellow student if they were about to launch their own style blog?</strong> My advice would be to stay true to yourself. It’s difficult to keep your blog unique when there are so many other style blogs out there but show what makes you different from others!</p>\n"

She loves purple, lipgloss, and her boyfriend - who takes some of the amazing photos seen on By Lisa Linh. Get to know this West Coast beauty with Blogspotter.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog is so interesting - it incorporates your personal style, photography skills and styling skills. When/why did you decide to launch By Lisa Linh - and at what point did “The BLOG” come into play?</strong> By Lisa Linh was officially launched on January 19, 2014. The website was created to showcase my photography and styling skills, while still presenting my own personal taste in fashion. When I initially started out in photography, I was interested in pursuing the event route and had my eye on being a wedding photographer. However, the wedding market is very saturated and of course, competitive. With the lack of time, as I work full-time, I couldn’t compare. I took a long hiatus from photography and during this time an idea sparked. Why not shoot for a reason? My friends often ask me for advice on what to wear to an event or for an occasion so I figured why not create a website that can provide them inspiration on putting together outfits? Incorporating my photography, I am able to visually assist anyone who is in need of outfit ideas. In addition, I purposely try to add diversity into the styling categories by including men, women and even children of all ages and sizes. The “models” you see on the website are friends, fashion bloggers and those who just have a genuine passion for fashion. No one is a real model or celebrity, they are just like you and I, which makes the website relatable. Of course after adding in the styling categories, I still wanted to showcase my own style so “The BLOG” was incorporated to allow those who are curious to see how I dress as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your logo is adorable. We’re gushing over the heart. And the script is perfect. Did you design it yourself?</strong> The logo was created by me however the script was one I downloaded randomly after a three month search for the perfect font. Who knew that finding a cursive font would be so hard! The heart is also a font that was found online.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you’re modeling, who takes your photos for you? You’re the perfect muse!</strong> Why thank you! My creative and very patient boyfriend is the guy behind the camera for my outfit of the days on “The BLOG”. I’ve actually learned most of my photography skills from him. But between you and I, I think I’m the better photographer – haha!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had to define your personal style with 5 adjectives, what would they be?</strong> Comfortable, chic, versatile, innovative and classic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Purple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you a hunter or a gatherer?</strong> Hunter. I am always looking to network, collaborate and find what I need.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk accessories. Is there one must-wear piece that you incorporate into every outfit?</strong> My Tiffany’s Infinity necklace that my boyfriend gave me for Christmas two years ago, he’d kill me if I didn’t. Just kidding! It’s an easy to wear item and goes with everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little about your personal style. Who are you inspired by?</strong> I’m inspired by Lucille Ball, my all-time idol. Her style was effortless, chic, classic and comfortable. I literally watch “I Love Lucy” every day and have the entire DVD collection of the show, along with her movies that she did with Desi Arnaz (Ricky Ricardo) and her later shows, such as “The Lucy Show”. Yes, I’m obsessed! Lucy did not have to be revealing whatsoever to look gorgeous, which I love. She did not wear 5” heels with her outfits, but kitten heels and flats, which is completely practical for women working 9 to 5 (like me). All her looks were amazing and so well put together!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite pair of shoes in your closet?</strong> Hands down my combat boots! Whenever I have a photo shoot, I’m in them. Whenever I go to Disneyland, I’m in them. If I can incorporate them into an outfit, I will.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you study as an undergrad? Do you find that you’re able to incorporate many of those skills maintaining, updating, and branding your blog?</strong> American Studies and if you’re wondering what that is, it is the study of American society through psychology, sociology and history. My emphasis was on pop culture, which is quite suiting for blogging as we’re consistently wanting to know what’s popular, new and trending. It also helps a lot with branding my blog as I understand the market and how to market a bit better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Daily beauty must-use: mascara or lipgloss?</strong> Lipgloss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Twitter or Instagram?</strong> Instagram.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does living in Los Angeles influence your style?</strong> How does it not? You will always discover a new art piece, food spot and see all sorts of crazy styles/people that will inspire you. You can visit the same place twice and still find something you did not see before. I love the L.A. culture, where else can you wear shorts nearly all year round?</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to give an aspiring blogger some insight into the world of styling, photography, and blogging, what would it be?</strong> Never give up, never settle for less than what you deserve and be prepared to work your ass off because it is straight competition out there. There are bloggers everywhere and photographers pop up like weeds. Styling is even worse because you have to know someone to get your foot in the door or intern consistently. BUT, if you love it then it won’t be bad at all plus it will pay off. Don’t be scared to push boundaries and most of all, stay true to yourself.</p>\n"

I decided to try and be a bit different and create a style column instead. Writing + fashion = my dream job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog really focuses on fashion writing, veering away from the standard personal style that you see in many fashion blogs. Tell us a little bit about your approach to this.</strong> I think with how many blogs there are now, you really have to veer out of your comfort zone and try something different! Something unique to get people wondering and interested. Otherwise, it blends into the background.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you get inspired?</strong> By reading mostly. Vogue, novels, poems. I’m a big fan of Bukowski and Stacey Duguid. And mood boards, whether that be on tumblr or in print magazines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you study as an undergraduate? Do you find that your degree has helped you maintain your blog (in any capacity)?</strong> I’m currently still an undergrad, actually! I study creative writing and yes, it has helped more than I ever thought. It’s taught me how to be a bit more daring as well as artistic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite blogger in the fashion/style blogosphere?</strong> Such a tough question! I love so many: Love Fashion Squad, The Haute Pursuit and Man Repeller. I’m also falling in love with Garance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you use social media to further the reach of the Girl with The Painted Pout brand?</strong> I do. I find that tweeting with others in similar ranks and aspirations bring more readers as well as inspiration for new posts. Google Plus is wonderful for its community aspects and I adore tumblr for quick visuals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personally, what’s your favorite social media platform?</strong> Twitter, definitely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lipstick: cherry red or brick red?</strong> Brick red. A classic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nailpolish: jet black or nude coated with chunky glitter?</strong> Nude without glitter. I don’t do glitter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite accessory in your wardrobe right now?</strong> I’ve been obsessed with my Zac Posen crossbody as well as my vintage gold bracelets I found at a Brooklyn market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has anything super cool happened to you since you started blogging?</strong> This! Chatting with insiders is something I’ve always admired.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one quote that you live by?</strong> “Don’t bend; don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.” —Franz Kafka</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em>She may only be 18 years old, but <strong>Grace Lee</strong> of <strong>Gracefullee Made</strong> never fails to impress us. The University of North Carolina journalism student adores Kate Spade, smiling, and A-line cuts. She also has a keen sense of awareness, knowledge, and experience when it comes to social networking and engaging with other bloggers and brands - most likely stemming from her fearless, hands-on approach to blogging. Given the quote she lives by, “if your dreams don’t scare you, they aren’t big enough”, we can’t be too shocked that she’s had so much success. In fact, we’re more than convinced that it will continue indefinitely.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok - “Gracefullee Made” has to be the cutest blog name, ever. (Your full name is Grace Lee) What gave you the idea to use it?</strong> Aw, thank you! Well, I’m a person who likes to stand out and I didn’t want my blog name to be something common. Also, how many people do you know that can fit their full name into their blog name? Exactly. One of my close friends in high school used to call me ‘Grace full Lee’ and it seemed fitting to use as my blog name.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk about your blog. It’s filled with pink, glitter, and smiles! What made you want to get into blogging/launch your own blog, and how long have you been blogging for?</strong> I liked to dress very stylishly in high school. It was rare for anyone to see me in a t-shirt or tennis shoes. On a daily basis, my classmates, friends, and even teachers would ask me where I got my clothes, shoes, accessories, etc. I decided it was best to blog about it. It was like having an online diary where I could post my looks, and then share what I was wearing. I have been blogging for four years now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you keep a steady following?</strong> Two words: social networking. I am an avid tweeter and instagram-mer. I try to write posts and say things that other bloggers and readers can relate to. Also, having an eye for what kind of shots you want is key. It’s almost like being a salesman because you’re constantly promoting your blog on social media and preserving the best image for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you connect/network with other bloggers? How do you go about initiating those conversations?</strong> I do! I’ve made a ton of blogger friends through social media, and I’ve only met a few of them in real life, but that’s only because it’s hard meeting up with bloggers that are many states away. But I do still keep in contact with them and even email them for upcoming blogger collaborations here and there. Usually, I’ll just shoot them an email or a text and the conversation just flows. Is it crazy to be close with people you’ve never met? It’s amazing how social media does that to us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong>\nAtlantic-Pacific, Pink Peonies, Cupcakes and Cashmere, Could I Have That?, and The Sweetest Thing are definitely a few of my favorite style inspirations and must-visit blogs. I’m particularly drawn to any blogs that can captivate readers with their words and creative photos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You blog from Chapel Hill, NC. How do your surroundings influence your style?</strong> Every day, I’m surrounded by copious amounts of college students on campus as I go to class, run errands, and take blog shoots. Therefore, I see a lot of styles on a daily basis. It’s definitely hard being motivated in Chapel Hill, especially because it’s a college town and most people like to wear sportswear and hoodies to be comfortable in class. But luckily, Pinterest and other fashion blogs keep me inspired.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer?</strong> Truth be told, most of my closest friends already know the answer to this one without even thinking twice about it. My favorite would have to be Kate Spade. I always stalk the NYFW collections every year and I simply cannot get enough of the brights, bows, and all things colorific.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> An A-line little black dress, a statement necklace, and a pair of colorful pumps. Classy and elegant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> Yes, I use sites like RewardStyle, Pradux, Chictopia, Pinterest, Lucky Community to share my blog posts and pictures with the fashion community. RewardStyle is a great way to not only find similar items, but also provides commission towards the blogger when that similar item is clicked on and purchased from the readers. My wonderful blog layout was created by <a href=\"http://www.shannonpagedesign.blogspot.com/\">Shannon Page Designs</a> who did an amazing job at glamming up my site!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “If your dreams don’t scare you, they aren’t big enough.” That has to be one of my favorite quotes, hands down. I am constantly pushing myself to be better and to shoot for high expectations. I want to inspire others, but at the same time, inspire myself as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you study as an undergrad? Has it helped you with your blog?</strong> I’m currently studying journalism and mass communications. I always had a knack for writing. I use my blog not only for personal style posts, but also a way to express my thoughts to my readers. I think it’s very important to have that voice as a fashion blogger. Majoring in journalism has helped with my blog. I’m currently taking a News Writing class, and it has really opened my eyes to information that I did not know about the world of journalism, and I am enjoying every step of the journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you, and what kind of camera do you use?</strong> When I first started my blog in high school, my younger brother who is 13, took my photos. Though, I technically dragged him outdoors most of the time, sometimes I want to say that he enjoyed playing “blog photographer” for me. Since bringing younger brothers with you to college isn’t allowed, I rely on my older sister, who is a senior here in Chapel Hill, or one of my best friends Ginger Melton. They are both supportive of my blog in every way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instagram or Twitter?</strong> Instagram all the way. I’m a firm believer that pictures have a way of telling a story in a deeper perspective than words can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vanilla or chocolate?</strong> Chocolate. Lady Godiva has my heart.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> It has taught me to always be careful with what I say and how I say it. We live in a world where words can be taken out of context or used in a different manner, and that is always something everyone should be cautious of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> I’m pretty sure receiving free packages in the mail from companies trumps all rewarding components of being a blogger. Am I right? Okay, all jokes aside. But I do love mail days and keeping in contact with companies that sponsor me. I’ve met some pretty incredible people and it’s nice to know that. It’s so great being able to boost both of our followers simply by helping each other out.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Johnnalynn Lynch</strong> is the bubbly blogger behind <strong>StushiGal Style</strong>, which means “prissy” (in a sweet way!) in Jamaican. While she works full time as a business analyst, she always seems to find time for StushiGal Style, noting “if you love what you do, you make time for it.” She’s an advocate for social media engagement (especially with respect to extending her immediate network) and loves peach cobbler (representing Georgia!). Johnnalynn has an undeniably strong work ethic and an intense passion for blogging, which shows us that she’s going no where but up within the style blogosphere.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You probably get this question all the time: but tell us all about the name of your blog “StushiGal Style”! What does it mean, and how did you come up with it?</strong> Ha! It’s funny but I actually don’t get that question all the time, and I find it weird that I don’t. My mother and father are from Jamaica and I’m sure most people are familiar with the dialect that’s spoken there. Jamaicans have a lot of funny names to describe people and things.The word “Stushi” is commonly used to describe a girl that is considered to be “Prissy”. One of my ex-boyfriends is Jamaican, and he used to call me that ALL the time. LOL! I guess it stuck because I immediately thought of it when the time came to name my blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I actually started blogging back in 2010 when I went to live in London for 2 months for work. I was so new to it all at the time that I didn’t purchase a domain name or publish those articles to the public. I really just didn’t know what I was doing then. In 2011, I “officially” started StushiGal Style under a different domain name which is a long, crazy story.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was it that made you really want to start blogging? When did you realize that your blog needed to happen?</strong> Fashion and Travel are two things that I’ve been passionate about from as far back as I can remember. When I took my first trip to London, I knew I could expect to see some of the most amazing style I’d ever seen. I made up my mind before leaving for that trip that I would start blogging.</p>\n\n<p>And blog, I did. I wrote every day while I was there. I took a weekend trip to Paris during my stay in London, and blogged there too. It was so inspiring! I realized then that I had something to say, a unique perspective that I wanted to get across. I might not work for Vogue or any other big name publication, but my voice meant something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a full time business analyst - yet you still have time to upload amazing posts and take beautiful photos. How do you manage it all? Do you have any always-implement rules with regards to time management?</strong> OMG, it’s so hard. LOL! I’ve since been promoted to a Project Manager position and I’m even busier now with my “day job” than I used to be. My love for blogging keeps me pushing forward. Because I do have a job, it was important for me to implement a blogging schedule.</p>\n\n<p>I go out on Sundays (come rain or shine) to take pictures for the coming week and literally spend that entire day on editing pictures and writing content. I post on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays with only a few exceptions. There’s just no other way to manage it if you have a job. If you love what you do, you make time for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You rock pop colors so well! (especially green!) Do you have a favorite pop shade that you always incorporate in your outfits?</strong> GREEN! It’s one of my all-time favorite colors. Truthfully, I love any kind of bright, vibrant color. I want people to be happy when they see my pictures and nothing says happy like a beautiful burst of color!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on social media, generally? You’ve established such a loyal following - on all major platforms! Do you find that it’s helped the growth of your blog?</strong> Social media is the key to success for bloggers. I can’t stress that enough. How else can you reach an audience of people that are located both inside and outside of the U.S.? There’s just no other way. It enables you to engage and connect with your readers beyond the pictures and content from blog posts. I truly believe that social media is what brings new readers to my blog and would be at a loss without it. Good SEO just isn’t enough by itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you use social media to connect with your fans, or do you reserve those communications for your blog/email?</strong> My rule is to always engage my social media channels to connect with fans. I have my social media channels connected through Wordpress, so that whenever I publish an article, it automatically feeds into all of those channels. It’s really easy that way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speaking of communication - do you ever reach out and network with other bloggers, just to network? If so, how do you go about initiating these conversations?</strong> Absolutely! Networking in this industry is SO important! I’m a member of the Southern Blog Society which has been a great way to connect with other local bloggers. They schedule quarterly blog meetups which is a wonderful way to meet some of the girls. We always exchange information when we see each other, and some of those connections have ended up in collaborations and guest blogger opportunities. I’m also a member of IFB (Independent Fashion Bloggers) which is a good way to network with bloggers not located in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Pinterest: which one is your personal favorite, and why?</strong> Instagram is my all-time favorite because it connects me to my readers on more of a personal level. I tend to use it for much more than just the blog, so my readers have a chance to get to know more about my other interests beyond fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you blog from (location)? Do you find that your surroundings (geographically) have a strong influence on your personal style?</strong> I live in and blog from Atlanta. Although there are some aspects of Atlanta that inspire my personal style, I would have to say that my travels abroad have been much more of an influence. I’ve been to London, Paris, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Chile, Jamaica, Argentina, Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines. All of those places have been an inspiration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends are you seeing for spring/summer?</strong> Well considering we’ve had Snowpocalypse in Atlanta recently, I haven’t seen much Spring/Summer trends here. But on TV and on the internet, I’m seeing lots of full midi skirts, mesh detail, white and crop tops! I can’t wait for it to get warm here!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s one unconventional thing that blogging has taught you (something you did not expect to learn through blogging)?</strong> I certainly never expected to learn that blogging can be a business or that it can lead to actual opportunities within the Fashion industry. Since I started my blog, I’ve had so many ideas that expand beyond the blog that could actually result in a new career. I’m excited to start exploring some of those ideas very soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plaid or stripes?</strong> Why choose?! Do a print mix and wear them together!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Peach cobbler or carrot cake?</strong> Definitely peach cobbler! I’m from Georgia, home of the Georgia Peach!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Red manicure or French manicure?</strong> French manicure for me. I’m more of a natural nail color person.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inspiration can really shape a blog post/photo session. Are there any blogs that you visit on a daily basis for inspiration?</strong> Atlantic-Pacific is my all-time favorite. Blair just always gets it right. I also really enjoy Viva Luxury, Tuula Vintage and Kendi Everyday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend was about to start her own fashion blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of essential expert advice you’d give her?</strong> Do it because you love it and not for financial gain. I’ve seen a lot of people start blogs and eventually give up because the expectation was for them to make money off of it. It really does have to be something you’re passionate about.</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Paulien Riemis</strong> is the beauty (no really, she’s a model) and brains behind <strong>Polienne</strong>, her semi-self titled blog (the blog name “Polienne” actually derives from an incorrect pronunciation of “Paulien”). The Belgian blogger has a serious weakness for knit beanies (she has about 12 now) and opts for green tea over coffee (unless the coffee comes in the form of a milk-laden latte or creamy macchiato). Oh, did we mention she’s also a student? Talk about wonderwoman!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, you are a student, a model (you’re absolutely beautiful!), and a blogger! How do you balance it all?</strong> First of all: thank you! I study only part time at university so I have more time to work as a model. My studies are always priority but since I earn my money by modeling and blogging these two are pretty important as well. The blogging wasn’t supposed to grow this big but now it actually takes up almost as much time as my two other occupations. Although planning isn’t my best feature, I always try to prepare my posts by shooting and writing in advance. Making lists of priorities definitely helps!</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love the name of your blog, “Polienne”. How did you come up with it?</strong> The blog name “Polienne” actually derives from an incorrect pronunciation of my own name, Paulien. Paulien is the Flemish version of Pauline and my modeling agency in Italy couldn’t help calling me ‘Polienne’. I thought it had this fun, almost Parisian schwung and decided to use it as my blog’s name!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Living in Antwerp must have a huge influence on your style. What do you love most about the city?</strong> Oh yes, Antwerp is a lot more inspiring than the tiny rural village I was raised! I simply love that you can find literally EVERYTHING on walking or biking distance. Antwerp is a rather small city but has so much to offer. I have about three coffee bars, a gym, a botanical garden, two supermarkets and a designer shopping street within 1km from my apartment. Also, there are so many different people with different cultures you can learn from!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite must-wear accessory in your closet right now?</strong> My beanies, I guess. I have a weak spot for headwear and in winter I wear my knit beanies non-stop. I think I have about 12 beanies now… They just complete every outfit and hide any bad hair days!</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s that time of year again - Fashion Week is right around the corner! Which designers are you keeping an eye on this season?</strong> I’m not a die hard Fashion Week follower but I’d like to see the new Isabel Marant collection! I’m also very curious for Carven and Chloé. You can probably tell that Paris Fashion Week is my favorite one!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You mention your love for cookies on your blog. Do you have a favorite-cookie preference?</strong> Hah, that’s a good one! I can’t help muching on chocolate chip cookies (so I often ignore these at the supermarket) but I love a good coconut cookie as well. I would probably eat any cookie you serve me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform, and why?</strong> I would say Instagram, but I really have been enjoying Pinterest lately. I’m not that blogger with solely white images on Instagram and in the end you’re never sure who’s watching your personal photos… I love the same visual aspect of Pinterest and the idea that you can gather your all of your inspiration on one page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What camera do you use? Who takes your photos? The photographs on Polienne are simply breathtaking!</strong> I have a Canon 550d with a 50mm f/1.8 lens. I actually have a lot of photographers! I usually meet up with other bloggers from Antwerp to shoot each others outfits, but my mom and friends help me out when there’s no one else around. My brother has been doing a lot outfit shooting for me as well lately. As long as the images are sharp, I can do almost ANYTHING with them in Lightroom :-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite weekend getaway spot in Europe?</strong> Paris, London and Amsterdam are very accessible by train from Antwerp so these three wonderful cities are the ‘easiest’ for me to do a quick city trip. But if I’d take the plane, I’d definitely go to Barcelona or Stockholm. These two cities have truly impressed me in the past and I feel like I could go there every weekend!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coffee or tea?</strong> Since I only drink coffee with loads of milk and latte macchiato’s aren’t seen as ‘real’ coffee, I’d say tea! I like my tea green, without sugar and per liter or two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summer or winter?</strong> That’s a hard one! Skiing is one of my favourite things to do but who doesn’t love a good palm tree? Plus, I prefer dressing up for colder weather but in the end I always long for some sun. Let’s keep it on summer!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Since you began blogging, what has been your biggest source of inspiration thus far?</strong> Since I’m kind of a Pinterest addict, I’d say loads and loads of pictures on the internet! Most of my first posts from back in 2009 are all ‘moodboard’ posts with random streetstyle photos. I just loving browsing through my folder with my favourite outfits to find inspiration for both my own outfits and my own photos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started blogging?</strong> That there is actually a business side to blogging! And that you can’t please everyone. I get so many emails from people or brands that want to collaborate but unfortunately I have to reject about 80% of them. I do want to make money with my blog but I don’t want to turn it into one big advertising website. It’s really hard for me to choose who to say yes to and who to turn down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite quote that you live by, if so, what is it?</strong> There’s one quote that I framed and put on my desk: “Do epic shit”. No need to explain…</p>\n"

The self-proclaimed “newbies” (they’ve been blogging now just over a year) have a definite future ahead of them within the fashion/style blogosphere. Take a look at their blog for instant inspiration (the photos will make you want to hop a flight to the West Coast, like - ASAP!) and be sure to keep this duo on your radar for months and years to come.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Velvet Sugar! The name of your blog is so… yummy. How’d you come up with it?</strong> Velvet Sugar is composed of two of us, both sisters and best friends since the day we were born! When coming up with our name, we wanted something that described both sides of our style and attitude. Velvet, being one of our favorite materials, is soft yet edgy and sugar just gives everything some sweet flava. You could call our style “sweet with an edge”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to start blogging?</strong> It definitely just happened one day! We both always got complimented on our personal style so we wanted a way to express our unique identity and fashion statements to our fans. We are also HUGE music lovers. Our blog not only lets us share our fashion favorites but also the radical tunes we listen to on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> We have been blogging for just over a year now. Still newbies but everyone has to start somewhere right!?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find that you had instant success with your blog, or did it take a little bit of time to build? How do you keep your following loyal?</strong> Blogging is something that definitely does not come with instant success. There are so many amazing and passionate bloggers this day in age - to stand out of the crowd you really need to take that extra step. We are still trying to get our foot in the door, but Instagram has a lot to do with our incline in success. We keep our following loyal by just being ourselves and hoping others enjoy our quirky lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> We love bloggers from Charcoal Alley, Le-Happy, and Born to Bother You…just to name a few. These lovely ladies have the edgy yet simple and “true to yourself” style that we adore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blogging is more than just pretty pictures and posts: it’s upkeep, branding, etc. Are there any websites or online resources that you turn to for guidance with respect to blogging and maintaining your blog?</strong> We enjoy turning to Refinery 29 and Lookbook.nu to get guidance and but we mainly just use our creativity and our gut when it comes to new directions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you had to jump any major hurdles since you launched Velvet Sugar? If so, what did you learn from it?</strong> Hmm major hurdles, probably nothing too serious.. yet. (Going to knock on wood now! haha). So far we are just going with the flow and seeing where it takes us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one brand/label everyday for the rest of your life, who would it be?</strong> ONE BRAND FOREVER!? Oh boy… It would have to be a toss up between UNIF and Sugarhigh Lovestoned. Can we have both please? :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “I always tell the girls, never take it seriously. If you never take it seriously you never get hurt. If you never get hurt you always have fun, and if you ever get lonely, just go to the record store and visit your friends” –Penny Lane (Almost Famous). Best movie ever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hair up or down?</strong> Definitely down! Rhi and I both have very similar hair (perks of the same gene pool) and we love to just let it run wild and free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photos are so bright, crisp, and sunny. Who takes your photos for you, and what kind of camera do you use?</strong> Thank you for those excellent adjectives! We mainly take pictures for each other, which can be a struggle since we don’t live in the same town. But we both love photography as well so it’s a treat to be on either side of the lens.

        "content"     : "<p><strong>Tell us about the The Moptop.</strong> The Moptop is my fashion blog that I started my senior year of high school after stumbling upon Free People. I was so inspired by their website and blog that I decided to make one of my own!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The name is so interesting! How did you come up with it?</strong> I’m a huge fan of The Beatles and my hair is always kind of messy and curly, so I thought The Moptop would be the perfect name!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for? Do you blog full time?</strong> I started my blog December of 2010. I blog as often as I can with school and work. I hope to someday blog full time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your long, dark hair. How easy is it to maintain your easy-going look?</strong> Thanks! My hair is naturally curly so I think that helps some. But I curl the top pieces that are kind of flat. I don’t brush my hair too often, which sounds weird but I think this helps is stay kind of messy and wavy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What brought you to the world of blogging?</strong> It was definitely seeing Free People’s blog and discovering all these people with blogs too. I never knew this was a thing, but I was so inspired by there creativity and outfits that I wanted to be a part of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are a few of your favorite designers?</strong> I don’t really follow high fashion too religiously, which I should probably start doing. But I am always wowed by Anna Sui and Dolce and Gabbana.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What inspires your personal style on a daily basis?</strong> My style icon, Alexa Chung, is always a great inspiration for me. As well as icons of the 60s such as Anna Karina and Bob Dylan. I love the classic styles of the past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you frequent?</strong> Flashes of Style is one of my favorites, I’ve been following Bonnie’s blog for a long time and I love how consistent she is with her style and vintage aesthetic. I also love Natalie Off Duty and Kelli Murray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could replace your whole wardrobe with one pieces from one designer, who would it be?</strong> That’s a hard one. Can I just replace my whole wardrobe with Alexa Chung’s closet? :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gray or grey?</strong> Black.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it that makes your blog unique and different from others?</strong> I really try to pick backgrounds that work with my outfit. I try to pick different locations rather than just always standing in front of the same wall or space. It’s almost like a photo shoot every time I take photos for my blog, I really want to work with the feel/vibe of the outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos? And what camera do you use? Do you have any tips for taking great photos?</strong> I usually take the photos myself with my tripod. I have a Canon Rebel t2i and I’m hoping to get a new lens soon! My advice would be just take your time, photography takes practice!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Obviously, first and for most, be true to yourself! I feel as though people really appreciate reading authentic blogs, it’s more interesting. And also, have fun! Try not and take it too seriously all the time… I need to work on that one too!</p>\n"

Blogspotter is obsessed with the way Cheong pairs clothing and accessories. Also, how gorgeous are her Singapore-based pictures? We want to visit. Check out Blogspotter’s conversation with Andrea of The Haute Heel.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you break into blogging?</strong> I started like most fashion bloggers, as a follower of some really great blogs and it transitioned into a desire for a creative outlet. I studied History of Art which is really theoretical, so I wanted to do something practical like styling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> The Haute Heel is three years old, I started it during my first summer of university.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time, or is it just a hobby right now?</strong> It’s a hobby that I really enjoy. I try to prioritize it whenever I have the free time but I have a full time job now that I have graduated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve switched up your style quite a bit. What was the reason for the shift?</strong> Part of it came with a huge lifestyle change. Moving to Singapore from London meant a lot of alterations to my style and wardrobe. I started with purging colour from my new purchases, everything was white, black, grey or red. Now I am more settled in my new city I feel as if a return to colour is due.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We all know the saying: a photo speaks a thousand words. What’s the key to taking a good photo?</strong> I take photos as part of my job now, so I always say great lighting and knowing how to smile. A lot of people find smiling really awkward (me in particular) because I had monstrous teeth and braces as a child. My friends always tease me because I look really serious in my blog photos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does living in London (a fashion mecca!) have a huge impact on your personal style?</strong> I was in London for eighteen years and it definitely did. Even the type of designers I was drawn to influenced my style. I loved layers, nudes, sparkly and sheer things as well as very classic cuts. London has a great sense of individualism and the best shopping ever, so I was never really hesitant to try out new combinations or looks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are a few of your favorite blogs? Where do you look for inspiration?</strong> I am totally in love with Jessica Stein of Tuula’s style. I am addicted to Instagram for my fashion inspiration, it has a great sense of real- time and really represents the zeitgeist of youth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nail polish: what is your safety it-always-works color? (Brand? Color name?)</strong> Deborah Lippmann has really beautiful and unique colours but right now I am all about the nudes. Their shade ‘Naked’ is my staple favourite. As for manicures, soft gel is the only way to go. I love a good French manicure so for DIY, Incoco do the best nail foils that last for two weeks and actually strengthened my nails.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong> Living in another city, reunited with my dog Gatsby, and my boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend was about to start her own fashion blog, what would be one piece of must-have advice you’d give her?</strong> I have always told my friends, if you are going to start, don’t give up after two months.</p>\n"

Take notice of this girl because she is taking the blogging world by storm.

You used to blog over at Fabric Snob. Why don’t you tell us a little bit about why you made the move over to your self-titled blog “Who is Apneet?”</strong> I wrote a <a href=\"http://fabricsnobblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/editors-letter-introducing.html\">detailed Editor’s Letter</a> about the change over at FS, but the short story is that I’ve outgrown the site. The name is very fashion-centric, and I would like to explore more and express more beyond just clothing.</p>\n\n<p>The goal at Who is Apneet? is daily blogging, forcing me to constantly be writing, taking photos, taking in experiences and sharing. Aiming to develop a new post every day is really helping me stretch my creative muscles. There’s still a fashion focus on Who is Apneet? but I’m also working on print projects, some exciting fashion collaborations, zines, and so much more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you study fashion formally as an undergraduate?</strong> I’m actually an undergrad here in NYC and I’m majoring in Music, with a concentration in Flute. I also served as an editor at our college newspaper for three semesters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos? They’re just beautiful.</strong> Aww shucks, I wish I could say I had a photographer but most of the time it’s just myself, my tripod, and a camera remote. If someone else shot a blog post, I always leave a credit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your posts ooze with color. We can’t stop staring. What gives you inspiration on a daily basis?</strong> Thank you! I’m inspired largely by my surroundings, the outside world wether it be the ocean or city buildings. I love color and texture, shapes and silhouettes. I’m also inspired by music, my favorite authors, and pretty much anything French.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are you wearing right now?</strong> My favorite thing to wear right now is this oversized 90’s Walmart sweater (yes, really) that’s completely falling apart. I got it years ago from a friend of mine and it’s been passed around our circle of friends many times. It’s my turn to wear it again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick: List the first 5 adjectives that come to mind when you think of your blog.</strong> Adventurous, whimsical, fresh, daring, and humorous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a Brooklynite. Have you always lived in Brooklyn? Does NYC generally have a strong influence on your style?</strong> I’m from the fairer coast! I grew up in the Bay Area, California, and moved to NYC in 2008 to attend college. Going from a season-less environment to four distinct weather periods has definitely influenced my style! The biggest thing I learned, out of necessity, is that layering is my friend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding your blog? If so, in what way?</strong> I think I enjoy Instagram the most. It’s a great way to connect with my readers, and share with them little snaps in real time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in a year? 3 years?</strong> I don’t often think about long-term planning… my goals and ideals change every other week so I have no idea! There are so many avenues I’ve paced down that there’s no telling where I’ll be or what I’ll be doing there, and that in itself is most exciting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking into consideration the experience you’ve garnered over the past few years, what’s one piece of essential advice you’d give to an aspiring blogger.</strong> I would say “be yourself.” It sounds lame but it’s really the best thing. Find your own voice and MAKE YOUR OWN RULES!</p>\n"

Beginning as a creative outlet in 2010, Kinney’s blog has transformed into a style resource for men and women. Trophy Boutique showcases “Before and After” transformations that ensures readers of her styling abilities. With its easy navigation and Kinney’s adorable sense of style, Trophy Boutique is the go-to read for fashion lovers everywhere.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Trophy Boutique!</strong> Trophy Boutique is a personal styling business dedicated to helping men &amp; women creatively and effortlessly express their personalities through their individual style. The Trophy Boutique blog is where I informally talk to my clients and potential clients, share outfit ideas, tips, and tricks and get to express my own personal style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into styling? Did you start blogging first, or vice versa?</strong> I began Trophy Boutique in blog form as a creative outlet in 2010. It began as a way to figure out how to shift my career from social work into fashion. I basically just photographed my outfit each day until I ended up meeting a personal stylist who showed me the ropes. I fell in love with personal styling, working with people to make them feel more confident and stylish, and have been building my business ever since!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Austin is such a beautiful place, filled with such unique style. How does living in Austin, Texas influence your style?</strong> Austin is great because you can really do your own thing without anyone blinking an eye. I mean, there’s a guy here that rides his bike around town in nothing but a g-string! I love to mix dressy pieces with casual ones so that you can basically go anywhere or do anything and not feel out of place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you formally study fashion and styling? If not, what did you focus on in college?</strong> I didn’t ever study fashion formally, but have had fashion magazines delivered monthly since I was 12 years old. I’ve always experimented with and had fun with fashion—I can’t ever remember a time when I wasn’t interested in trying to figure out how to never wear the exact same outfit twice. In college I studied psychology and art and I also have a Masters in social work from Columbia. I love figuring out what makes people tick and how to help people feel better, and styling has become my unique brand of therapy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love the “before and after” section of your website. Why do your clients work with you?</strong> Thanks! My clients are the coolest. I think I typically get hired by people who want to make a change and are a little nervous to open up in this way. I offer a judgment-free, not-so-serious approach that makes the process comfortable and easy. I don’t have a bunch of specific, hard and fast rules that people must follow, instead I approach my clients as individuals, and help them discover what makes them feel best based on who they are as people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite small accessory?</strong> My rings! I just started wearing a bunch of rings in the past few years and now I feel all weird and naked without them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had to size up your personal style in a few words…</strong> I would say that my style is comfortable and modern with a touch of androgyny. I used to be a lot more colorful and girly, but lately I’ve been appreciating more minimalism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Probably a drapey top, skinny jeans, chunky ankle boots, and a structured leather jacket or blazer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform?</strong> Instagram, 100%. I think it’s the most creative and I love being able to keep a pretty album to remember the little moments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “You have everything you need.” It’s difficult for me to just be appreciative of what I have in the present—I’m always thinking ahead to where I want to go next. I have a poster on my bedroom wall with that phrase on it in giant letters to remind me to stay in a “having” state of being.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be yourself. Don’t get too caught up in what other people are doing. Only do or say what comes naturally to you, otherwise it will come off as phony to your readers. To me, connection is the most important thing, so when I post, I imagine I’m talking to the exact type of person I want to connect with, and that helps keep me focused, authentic, and consistent.</p>\n"

The Marcy Stop oozes New York — leaving very little not to absolutely love. Plus, Lauren’s a stunning brunette who assuredly turns heads all around the Big Apple. Take a look for yourself — but before you do, see what she has to say about blogging, style, school, work, and inspiration.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the name of your blog, “The Marcy Stop”. Where did it come from?</strong> The Marcy Stop is a reference to my subway stop in Brooklyn: Marcy Ave. It’s the first stop out on the JMZ train, and one of the main entry points into South Williamsburg. Conceptually, I always wanted the blog to be very neighborhood-centric, and I knew it was important for the name to represent that. A few martinis later with my close friend Micol, one of the original co-founders of the blog, and the name became final.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I’ve been blogging for a little over two years now. Crazy how time flies!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was it that really made you want begin blogging?</strong> It was really Micol, my former blogging partner-in-crime, who pushed me to start the blog. She was looking for an outlet to practice her photography and I was looking for a creative side-project, so it wasn’t hard for her to convince me to join forces and collaborate. Since then it’s quickly become a passion project of my own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you study fashion and/or style as an undergraduate? If not, how did you learn the ins-and-outs of the industry?</strong> I went to school at NYU and studied Graphic Communications as an undergrad (a mix of PR, Graphic Design and Advertising/Media), so academically I was definitely on this route. However, the eclectic assortment of internships I took part in and the jobs that followed, were what truly influenced my views on fashion.</p>\n\n<p>One of my first internships was working as an assistant to fashion writer Karen Robinovitz, followed by stints at companies like YSL, Gucci, Harrison and Shriftman, and FOX. When I finally graduated, I wound up working at a celebrity magazine for a few months, spent a few years in fashion public relations, then took on a freelance gig as a fashion editor at Rizzoli. I’m currently a design director at the Brooklyn-based creative agency, HOWL Group, where I work with a variety of fashion and lifestyle clients.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, I’ve had a wide range of experiences in fashion, and the opportunity to view the industry from so many angles has given me a truly unique perspective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My personal style really depends on my mood. Sometimes it’s boho and eclectic. Other times it’s modern and clean. However, I’m obsessed with vintage and thrift store shopping, so regardless of my mood, it’s always about mixing in those one-of-a-kind finds with more classic, tailored, or high-end pieces. And ultimately, it’s all about comfort and feeling great in what I’m wearing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites do you follow for inspiration?</strong> A few of my favorite blogs/sites at the moment are: Le 21eme, Lellavictoria, Purse ‘N Boots, and A Pretty Pass, but I’m always on the search for new blogs and inspiration!</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to more mainstream coverage I love Refinery 29 because they really dive into everything from fashion and beauty, to entertaining and décor. Instagram has also become a great source of inspo for me, but it takes longer to peruse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had $1,000 to spend on a wardrobe piece, what would you spend it on? (and why!)</strong> I’d probably put the money towards a Chanel bag. It’s such a classic piece that can stand the test of time and be easily dressed up or down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Red or nude colored nail polish?</strong> Like fashion, my nails always depend on my mood. I’m big on DIY nail art, and change up my nail polish a few times per week, so I’ve tried every color/pattern under the sun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your favorite trends this season?</strong> Fringe, full skirts, and sheer paneling. I’m a sucker for different cuts and fun details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer a few words of wisdom to an aspiring blogger, what would they be?</strong> Do it because you love it, and not for the promise of free clothes or instafame. If you’re passionate about your blog and your style, your readers will be able to tell, and you’ll develop a following over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats the most rewarding component of blogging?</strong> The most rewarding component has been getting out from behind the computer and camera and having a chance to meet and mingle with other bloggers and fashion industry insiders. Whether attending an event, setting up a brunch date with another blogger, or collaborating with a new company, the opportunity to socialize with other creative people and work with up-and-coming brands has really given me the most joy and fulfillment when it comes to blogging.</p>\n"

From start to finish, what is your typical day like?</strong> I live in Venice and work downtown LA in the arts district, I wake up, drive to work, get an iced vanilla latte (easy vanilla) and work until about 8, everyday is something new! I love wining and dining that’s going out for me, so I usually talk my boyfriend into going somewhere nice and eating and drinking until the place shuts down and head home to do it all again tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your clothing line. Which came first, your brand, or your blog?</strong> AGAIN is my baby. It is a women’s contemporary line out of Los Angeles. We have a small team here and produce everything in LA. Its inspired by vintage, and modernized for women now days. I’d like to say it’s a cooler look to dressing nice. I actually had my blog first!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you get inspiration for your blog?</strong> I don’t really. I share what I am wearing, what I like, things I find and a lot about the brand!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites do you read on a daily basis?</strong> Lately I am reading news. I never really did that before because it was so negative, I look at tumblr a lot looking at design, and a lot of interior photos, its nice to look at something else inspirational other then clothes and the blogger world has gotten so crazy I can’t keep up, Instagram has changed everything because that’s like everyone’s little blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has blogging changed your outlook on fashion and personal style?</strong> It has a bit… Fashion in general is bit bogged down by all of the influencers now. An icon doesn’t seem as sacred as they used to be, seems like now anyone can be an icon.</p>\n\n<p>As for it changing my personal style I don’t think so, my style changes with the practicalities of my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I think my personal style is glamorous at heart, but functional at the moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fun question: what’s your favorite color?</strong> Shiny white</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> To be different and keep working!

I also inspire girls to create outfits on a budget because there are many girls out there just like me who can’t always afford designers clothes. I want them to know that it’s okay! You can still look amazing by getting creative. Shop affordably then mix and match your old and new clothes. It works! Occasionally, I like to incorporate posts about events I’m hosting or attended, giveaways, and new items that my readers need to try.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re so beautiful! And you look so happy in all of your posts. You obviously love blogging. What gives you inspiration for your content?</strong> Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I only just recently realized that I love to smile in my pictures. I was so serious for awhile. My photographer friend, Ryan Chua really helped to bring it out of me and now I just can’t stop smiling! What inspires me for my content is knowing that I have the chance to inspire other girls through my outfits and through my writing. Also, looking at other blogger posts through Instagram really inspires and challenges me to come up with real original content.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites do you follow?</strong> My favorite blogger has always been Julie from Sincerely Jules. I can definitely relate to her California cool casual style. Her photos are always amazing as well. She’s my biggest inspiration. I also keep up with the latest fashion trends by reading Lucky Magazine online and I love Pop Sugar Fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to wear one outfit everyday for the rest of the year, what would it be, and why?</strong> I’ve been on a realistic binge lately. I’ve realized that running around Los Angeles everyday takes an enormous amount of effort. So dressing up in high heels and a skirt isn’t going to cut it. Jeans, a cropped tank, a leather jacket, boots and a beanie does.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite color?</strong> Black!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pearl studs or diamond studs?</strong> I wear my diamond studs that my mom gave me as a gift years ago literally every day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is your favorite designer? (or favorite designers)</strong> Marissa Webb, Rebecca Minkoff, Thakoon, Alexander McQueen and Chanel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instagram or twitter?</strong> Instagram now and forever!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I actually wouldn’t have done anything differently since I began blogging. It’s been great since the beginning and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Remember to always love yourself and who you are cause if you don’t, who will? Don’t change for anyone!</p>\n"

The trendy site was started by Berkley in 2011. All photography is mastered by her adoring husband. Are you obsessed yet? If that wasn’t enough, the site’s Pinterest and Instagram pages are too perfect for words. <strong>Casual Glamorous</strong> is a combination of all things fashion, cooking, and inspiration.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your blog. It’s so crisp and fresh. What made you decide to start blogging?</strong> I started my blog in 2011 as a way to channel my creative side and love for fashion. I loved reading fashion blogs and was inspired to start my own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time?</strong> My full time job is now being a mommy to my 1 year old daughter. I love blogging and I try to post 3-4x a week. I would love for my blog to turn into an income producing job!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> I read A LOT of blogs so it’s really hard for me to pick a few. I really love street style blogs and of course Pinterest. Some of the street style blogs I like are The Sartorialist, and Carolines Mode.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You used to live in New Jersey, and now you’re out on the west coast! Was the switch hard? Have you adjusted?</strong> I moved to LA in 2001 and the transition was VERY hard. I was so young and barely knew anyone out here. I still can’t believe I made such a huge (and far!) move at such a young age. I met my husband here and had my daughter here. I miss my family on the east coast so much, but my life is here now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who takes your photos for you? Is there a place around town that you always shoot? If so, why that location?</strong> I take all food photos and my amazing husband takes all of my outfit photos. He’s so supportive of me and my blog. When it comes to the location for my photos, I love a good spray painted wall or an old warehouse for a back drop. I love Brooklyn and those types of backgrounds bring me back there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite fabric?</strong> If I had to choose one fabric, I’d say silk. I’m a sucker for a great silk blouse!</p>\n\n<p><strong>You also blog about cooking, and we must confess, some of your meals look amazing. Did you ever take cooking classes? How did you learn to cook?</strong> I NEVER took any cooking classes. My mom has always been a great cook and I learned a lot from her. Pinterest also is a source of inspiration for my recipes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hair up or down?</strong> Down. Loose, beachy waves all the way!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite clothing designer? (Try! If you could only shop one brand… what would it be?)</strong> Oh my, this is a tough one! I’d have to go with Rag &amp; Bone. I love a casual/chic/relaxed kind of look and their designs incorporate all of that. Plus, their boots are pretty amazing as well! I could wear head to toe Rag &amp; Bone everyday and be perfectly happy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Skinny jeans, a slouchy v-neck tee, moto boots and a leather jacket. Oh, and a Chanel bag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> Good things come to those who wait.</p>\n"

She draws style inspiration from socialite Olivia Palermo and Hollywood starlets like Zoe Saldana, Emma Stone and Cate Blanchett, starlets known for their chic and elegant style. Read on to find out her number one style tip and what items are on her must-have list!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your celebrity style icons?</strong> My celebrity style icons are Olivia Palermo, Zoe Saldana, Cate Blanchett and Emma Stone has been looking so fabulous lately, she’s a new fave.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where are your favorite places to shop?</strong> I adore thrift stores and consignment shops because you never know what you’re going to find, it’s like digging for treasures! Also I love Zara, ASOS, J Crew, and H&amp;M.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your style?</strong> My style is best described as structured feminine. I love clean lines and ladylike silhouettes. I sometimes look back at my blog posts and realize that I have worn skirts or dress for 10 days straight! I don’t know how it happens, but I feel best when I am wearing something feminine. It makes me feel more confident and put together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your must-have items?</strong> A structured top handle tote, the perfect shade of red lipstick, cuticle oil, SPF 50+ moisturizer, a great fitting pair of jeans, nude pointy toe pumps, sparkly shoes, and big glamorous studs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you love most about fashion?</strong> What I love most about fashion is its ability to transform a person. If you want to be punk rocker chic one day and bohemian the next, you can do that with a quick trip to the closet. Fashion is fun but it’s also beautiful and inspiring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any style tips?</strong> The most important style tip is to dress for your body type and to make sure to get things tailored. A $15 dress that fits your body perfectly will always look better than the $200 ill-fitting one.</p>\n"

She has graduated from her days of chunky platforms to simpler, classier pieces, giving her that cool girl je ne sais quoi that is hard to look away from. Her enviable travel destinations and laidback vibes make Moeh Fashion an inspiration destination for budding It Girls everywhere.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your blog!</strong> Moeh Fashion started as a personal project. I had just started college, and being that I attend FIT, I knew I would be networking with a lot of people in the fashion industry and I really wanted some sort of portfolio that I could give. My blog started out as just that, and as I was experimenting with posts I realized how much I enjoyed blogging. I started sharing my personal style, photography, any collaborations and work I was doing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did you get the name from?</strong> The name was inspired by 2 things. Mo, in a very informal way, means more. Since I knew I wasn’t the first to be sharing personal style on the web, I felt I was just sharing more fashion. I then took the spelling of my best friends moms name, Moeh, who had inspired me in my younger fashion years and combined it with the idea of more fashion. Hence, Moeh Fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite part of blogging?</strong> My favorite part about blogging is exploring to find good places to shoot. My blog gives me a reason to get out and see new places with friends or visit usual spots just for fun. It also keeps me motivated, busy, and always on my toes with new ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites do you read?</strong> I get most of my daily reads from Facebook, Twitter, and/or Pinterest. Refinery29 is one of my favorite websites to browse for news and fashion. It’s very easy to get lost in their website which is why I enjoy it so much.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you get your inspiration?</strong> A lot of my inspiration has come from Pinterest. It’s been a platform that allows me to gather all of the ideas and things I like including more than just outfits. I find my inspiration comes from seeing style in all fields such as interiors, food, travel, beauty, as well as fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has blogging changed your outlook on fashion and personal style?</strong> I think the whole concept took me by surprise. The opportunities for bloggers in the industry right now are definitely pretty amazing. It’s also very inspiring to be able to inspire others with everyday looks. Many people can’t take a high-end magazine and replicate what they like into to real life fashion. Personal style bloggers make that much easier for their followers. I think it also goes to show how much opportunity there is in fashion in general. Opinions are everything in this industry, express yours on the Internet and you may be sitting front row at next fashion week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite designers/brands?</strong> I love discovering new and smaller brands. I am currently in Australia, and discovering Aussie brands has been a lot of fun. A few I love are Seafolly Australia, Mode Collective, and Zimmermann.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your style?</strong> I laugh because if I were asked this questions 3 years ago my answer would’ve been extremely different. There’s something amazing about growing up and the changes a person can go through mentally as well as physically. I love being able to look at my old posts, when I was wearing chunky rings and chunky platform heels on a daily basis. Now I resort to basics, denim and a lot of black. I prefer a minimal and mature look at the moment and I feel a lot more comfortable being in something practical, minimal, yet stylish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your first memory of fashion?</strong> My first fashion memory definitely had to have been trying on all of my older sisters clothing. I remember I used to be so upset because nothing fit me. I was too small to wear “big girl” clothing and I couldn’t wait until I could get their hand-me downs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite fashion quote or motto?</strong> This doesn’t have much to do with fashion but it’s one of my favorite quotes, and filed under #wordstoliveby. “Do not chase people. Be you and do your own thing and work hard. The right people who belong in your life will come to you, and stay.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the key to having a good sense of style?</strong> The best way to having a good sense of style is being aware of what works for your body and then stick with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick, think of your wardrobe (however big it may be!). What’s your favorite garment?</strong> A vintage oversized black/navy blazer that originally had long sleeves and shoulder pads so big you can easily be confused with a football player. I decided to chop off the sleeves and take out the pads, and now I have a very structured and long blazer vest. It is the perfect layering piece for both summer and winter. I wear it over jackets, under jackets, by itself, and just about everything else possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> I find a lot of people think having a blog is easy, but they don’t realize how time consuming the process can be until they begin and fail. My advice is if this is truly your passion, or hobby then it is an amazing way to create and share your content, meet new people, and potentially start your own business. It’s been an amazing journey!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Amanda Brohman</strong> of <strong>The Style Gossiper</strong> is not your ordinary 19-year-old. The super-chic blogger from Sweden  may be young, but she has a pretty loyal following - worldwide.  In her own words, “she’d rather gossip about fashion than people”. Now based in New York City, this Style Gossiper continues to inspire her readers with her fresh, minimalistic, and oh-so-real style.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you break into blogging?</strong> When I was 16 years old I started getting into fashion and started to develop my own personal style, something I really hadn’t been interested in at all before then. And that’s why I started blogging, to share my newly-found interest with people who were equally as passionate about the same thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> Since I was 16, so almost four years now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You have a strong international presence - your style is world-wide influential! Tell us a little about this.</strong> First of all, thanks so much for saying that. I don’t really know how it’s reached the worldwide appeal that it has, something that happened early on in my ‘blogging career’. But I suppose I have a pretty unique yet relatable mix of Scandinavian minimalism and straight, clean lines combined with the more preppy American fashion, and then some added edgy details. People seem to like it and I’m happy that they do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you still blog for VeckoRevyn? How did you get into that?</strong> No I only blogged for them for about nine months before I moved on to my own blog and at the same time changed my blog’s name to The Style Gossiper. It was a great experience working with such a big magazine, but in the end I felt I didn’t have the freedom I wanted in terms of editing content and placement of ads for example, so it felt better to be able to decide everything by myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sweden is so beautiful. Is your personal style heavily inspired by Swedish architecture and interior design?</strong> Sweden and being Swedish and Scandinavian has undoubtedly inspired my style and is always going to be the foundation of my style choices. I’m almost subconsciously drawn to everything that has Scandinavian looking design and some of my absolute favorite designers are Swedish. Swedish fashion and architecture/interior design look so similar, too, everything is clean, white, minimalistic. Although it is only recently that I’ve really been drawn to the minimalistic style on another level, if you go back in my archive you will see a lot of non-Swedish looking ensembles. But I suppose becoming an adult makes me recognize my roots even more</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you take your own photos?</strong> I edit all of my photos myself and I’m usually the ‘fashion director’ of all of my photos, meaning that I, in most cases, tell the photographer how I want the photo to come out. But since it is so complicated to take photos of myself, especially on the crowded streets of New York, I have great help from my friends and also my mom. They’re all really talented, so I’m lucky.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What camera do you use?</strong> I use a Nikon D5100 with a 35 mm f/1.8 d lens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In 5 words, how would you describe your personal style?</strong> Oh that’s tough. Scandinavian, minimalistic, preppy, ladylike, sophisticated yet a bit grungy. It’s a bundle of contradictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are are few of your favorite blogs? Where do you look for inspiration?</strong> I have so many favorites. I really love The Sartorialist, he has a way of capturing things that it’s just impossible not to be inspired and also makes you see how some things you never thought you would wear in fact could be super cool if you wear it in the right way. I also spend too much time on Tumblr, browsing various blogs. But then I also have the great advantage to nowadays live in New York, and I get inspired everywhere I go by people on the street here, or a nice boutique, or a beautiful piece of art.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You just cut your hair - we LOVE it! Was that hard to do?</strong> I did, and thank you! I have been wanting to do it for a long time so it was a very planned decision, but a bit scary in the moment my hair dresser cut it. I have never had this short hair since I was a baby, I guess. But now I love it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends do you anticipate will take over this spring/summer?</strong> That’s always something I have a hard time talking about. I don’t know why and it’s probably bad of me, but I don’t pay much attention to what the latest trends are. I sort of just develop my own style, and even when styling others, according to what I think will look good and then sometimes it happens to be really trendy or even trendsetting and sometimes it’s not.</p>\n\n<p>But having said that, pastels always appear every spring and summer, which I love. I’ve bought a lot of shirts, and a suit, so I will probably be sort of strict looking this summer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us one unconventional thing that blogging has taught you.</strong> I don’t know if it’s unconventional, but don’t be too nice to companies who want you to promote their products on your blog. I see a lot of bloggers, and I have been one myself at one point, who accept any bad quality item a company sends their way and then tries to convince their readers that the ill-fitted jacket is in fact the best jacket they’ve had in years. Be honest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your best friend was about to start her own fashion blog, what would be one piece of must-have advice you’d give her?</strong> Funny you should say that, my best friend has a fashion blog and it’s really good: <a href=\"http://corneliahelleday.se\">corneliahelleday.se</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But in general I would say, don’t copy anyone else’s concept because no one wants to read something that has already been said and made. Instead use your own unique ideas and style to make something of your own. And good pictures is always crucial.</p>\n"

Double the outfits, travel spots, and fashionable adventures are packed into their blog. Each photo showcases the girls’ cheery and colorful yet inimitably chic style. These sisters prove that when it comes to living well, two heads are better than one.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you start How Two Live?</strong> We wanted a way to keep in contact when Stef moved to Paris for six months. Who knew that a year and half later our little diary would be consuming our lives!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are two heads better than one when it comes to blogging?</strong> Definitely! We’ve recently discovered that if we get up at 6:30am and each do emails and admin for four hours, then we can be out and about by 10:30am and we’ve already pumped out an average person’s entire workday. Now we just have to work on getting up that early.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you come up with creative ideas for your blog?</strong> It’s so great having someone to bounce your ideas off. Once in a while we’ll hold brainstorming sessions together in our home office, where we’ve created a beautiful white space with a giant glass board to write ideas on (with our pretty pink marker). Having a space that you feel relaxed and inspired in is key!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What other blogs/websites/magazines do you read on a daily basis?</strong> Trashy mags are our weakness, we love reading a little celebrity gossip on Perez or TMZ. Stef is also weirdly obsessed with reading the news, and is always on current events websites like time.com.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name some of your style icons and tell us why they inspire you.</strong> Rainbow Brite is the coolest. She’s never afraid to rock the clashing colours, and is all about platform shoes. She’s also got the messy bun down pat. We also love Anna Dello Russo for similar reasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick: What word defines each of your personal styles?</strong> Unpredictable. For both.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do either of you have a go-to brand or look that makes you feel the most you?</strong> Our Shakuhachi pieces probably take up half our wardrobe, and we keep going back for more because they always get it right and they’re so us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you go about finding such unique items worthy of sharing with your readers?</strong> We’re really lucky that we have a lot of people that contact us who make amazingly creative and quirky things, and when we find things we love we can’t wait to get sharing them. We’re currently working on a new cool way we can constantly be sharing these awesome finds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What clothing, beauty product or accessory could you never live without?</strong> Sunglasses! They’re great to hide behind when you’re tired or having an off day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you make your blog stand out?</strong> We try not to look too much at what other blogs are doing, and let ourselves be inspired by different things like the places we travel to and people we look up to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has blogging boosted your general creativity?</strong> It hasn’t necessarily boosted it, but it’s definitely been a great outlet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has launching, maintaining and revamping your blog taught you?</strong> That bloggers often don’t get enough credit for the work they put into what they do. Often it will be a little awkward when someone asks what we do, because when we tell them we’re bloggers they assume we’re just lazy people who do nothing with our lives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring fashion bloggers?</strong> Come up with a point of difference - for us, this is being sisters who are also best friends, and having pretty quirky style. And it’s an obvious point but get yourself out there on social media as much as you can, work out what your followers love looking at or hearing, and keep posting cool original content based on what you’re best at.</p>\n"

Read on, Studs and Sapphires is the perfect source of inspiration for those looking for a healthy dose of studded + slightly sassy style.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Studs and Sapphires! The name of your blog is so juicy. How’d you come up with it?</strong> I have to admit that it was a spur of the moment thing. I had spent countless hours and days trying to find the perfect name. Since I was planning on focusing more on personal style, my friend asked me to describe myself and my style using different adjectives. My style definitely has a touch of edginess to it and I love to accessorize. Wearing my favorite studded leather jacket at the time and jeweled accessories, Studs defines the touch of edge and Sapphires is a reflection of all the bejeweled accessories. And that is how “Studs &amp; Sapphires” was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did (or do!) you go to school and where did you grow up?</strong> I went to school at The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and studied Merchandise Product Development. While working as an Assistant Designer, I went back to school and got my Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management. I am a California native, raised in L.A. Although I love to travel, Southern California is where my heart truly is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog is so cute, so candy-colored and bright! What gives you inspiration for your content?</strong> Although I love monocratic styling, candy colors are always fun and add a touch of personality to everything. My content on my blog focuses on personal looks, fashion, beauty, and what inspires me on the daily. If I am in the shopping mood, my content might include a “wish list or what’s hot”. If I see myself consistently incorporating a specific trend into my outfits, I might style one look various ways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite blog? What other blogs do you look to for style ideas and inspiration?</strong> I have many bloggers that I go to for style ideas and inspiration. Some of my favorites include L.A natives, Peace Love Shea, Song of Style, and Sincerely Jules. I also love Hungarian blogger Cashmere in Style, because her style is very similar to mine. Most of my style ideas and inspiration comes from street style</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your hair is so pretty! Does it naturally curl like that? If not… tell us how you do it!</strong> Naturally curly? I WISH! My hair is as straight as it can be! I use a 1” curling iron and it definitely takes a long time to do! (Just ask my friends as they sit and wait for me to get ready!). I plan to incorporate beauty and hair tutorials this year so stay tuned!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photographs are perfect: clear and well lit, with a hint of sparkle! For those who are trying to master the art of photography (with respect to fashion blogging) - what advice can you provide?</strong> You don’t need a great camera or a lot of technical skill to take interesting, inspiring photographs for your blog. You just need the right photography tips.</p>\n\n<p>Lighting – Lighting is the most important aspect when aiming to produce clear and focused images. Take advantage of dry days to photograph outside and the sun does not need to be blazing down, in fact natural sunsets can sometimes create the best pictures.</p>\n\n<p>Location &amp; Background – Always be cautious and consistent with your location and the background of your photos. ( I am still working on this!)\nOutfit photos – Aim to fit your entire self into the frame, not forgetting some close up details shots of your accessories or shoes. The best self-portraits are taken with confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this is useful to a wide section of bloggers who are interested in improving their photography skills. I am definitely no expert and learn new tips everyday as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you blog full-time? If not, would you if you could, and why?</strong> I do not blog full- time at the moment because I also work in the fashion industry during the week. If I could, I would, which will be my focus this upcoming year. My full-time occupation is to inspire individuals daily, whether it’s through a motivational story/quote or an outfit that reflects a significant story. I hope to accomplish all of that through my blog, “Studs &amp; Sapphires”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s been your look posted on your blog thus far? Why?</strong> My look changes every day depending on my mood. I may be feeling a bit of “rocker chic” one day and “feminine and flirty” the next. However, recently I have been including a touch of plaid and leather in every outfit. I am also a big fan of mixing silhouettes to create a fun dimensional look. I love to experiment with my looks and I’m open to different styles and silhouettes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Polka dots or stripes?</strong> Polka dots! Although different stripe variations are a fun look, I can definitely say I own more polka dots in my closet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glitter or sequins?</strong> I don’t usually wear glitter or sequins but if I had to choose, I would have to say sequins. Sequined elbow patches or sequined sleeve details are a perfect day-to-night look, and can give any outfit that “glam” you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I would have started blogging sooner! Before I started my blog, I had been debating for a long time and if there is anything I could have done differently is be more assertive. A few years ago, the blogging industry was not as evolved and influential, whereas now it has become more mass produced. However, I am really grateful and thankful for starting this journey and for all of my followers who have been supporting me and all the new friends I have made along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve had great success since you hit the ground with Studs and Sapphires. Do you have any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> “Self-confidence is the best outfit. Wear it, rock it and own it”. Blogs have significantly impacted our world today and will continue to evolve our future in fashion. A true authentic voice will always find its way to stand out. Stay true to your style and self, you will see endless opportunities come your way!</p>\n"

        "content"     : "<p><em><strong>Polish and Pout</strong> is a beauty blog curated by golden girl and self-proclaimed false eyelash junkie <strong>Jessica Palmer</strong>. The Sacramento, California based blogger knows a thing or two about beauty. During the day, she is a full-time makeup artist, catering to the needs of blushing brides up and down the West Coast. Jessica uses Polish and Pout to educate her readers and clients through the use of how-tos and step-by-step beauty tutorials. Oh, and she also throws the occasional top-secret-makeup-artist-trick up there… every once in a while. Trust us: it’s all the more reason to make Polish and Pout a daily tune-in.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What inspired you to start Polish and Pout?</strong> Being a makeup artist, sharing beauty tips is part of what I do already. I worked behind the makeup counter for a number of years and was so used to educating people on products and sharing techniques. I also love writing and social media, so once I started my own artistry business, I decided it made sense to start a blog so I could have a way to connect with my friends and clients about beauty. I’m so very glad I did! P&amp;P quickly took on a life of its own and became my business name as well!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you think it is important to share your beauty adventures with the world?</strong> I believe that we all have a story to tell, mine just happens to include lots of lipstick! It is my goal that by sharing my beauty adventures, people would be inspired while gaining beauty knowledge. Makeup isn’t just makeup. The right lipstick can be courage, the perfect foundation can bring healing, and a great nail polish can be joy. I absolutely LOVE what I do and I can’t help but tell my story and the stories of the amazing people I meet. I like to say that I’m telling stories through makeup and imparting confidence along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is one of the most useful skills you learned as a makeup artist?</strong> Oddly enough, I’d say communication! Makeup is a very personal thing. Everyone is used to seeing their face a certain way and it’s important to understand a persons lifestyle, tastes, and comfort levels before applying makeup. Also, having a completely bare face while face to face with another woman is incredibly vulnerable. So learning how to ask the right questions, and earn someone’s trust in a short amount of time is the most valuable tool in a makeup artist’s kit!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide which looks to feature on your blog?</strong> For the most part it is determined by either the questions I’m being asked frequently, or what’s on my radar trend wise. If I find that my clients are asking for a specific look or technique that’s usually a cue that others are probably wanting the same info.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name a few makeup artists whose work you admire.</strong> I really look up to Pati Dubroff. She doesn’t over complicate things and always let’s the persons natural beauty shine through. She’s behind the red carpet looks of celebs like Naomi Watts and Charlize Theron. Pati is the epitome of zen and is very present in the moment. Meeting her and hearing her share her story is one of my favorite moments as an artist. I also love celebrity artist Lisa Eldridge. I’ve never met her before, but I am a huge fan of her YouTube channel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you find yourself gravitating to certain looks, shades, or brands over and over?</strong> I like to call myself a recovering brand snob. I started in the industry working for a luxury cosmetic line, so for many years I stuck to high-end designer makeup. I really love Dior, Chanel, and Bobbi Brown. The longer I’ve been an artist though, the more I realize that every line has something wonderful and something terrible. It’s just a matter of trying things out. Not everyone wants to spend $40 on a lipstick and that’s ok! There are some awesome drug store products that I swear by and I love bargain hunting. The majority of my clients are brides, so a subtle brown smokey eye and loads of individual lashes is definitely one of my go-to looks. For myself though, I’m a bold lip lover for sure! Give me red lipstick and I feel powerful enough to rule the world!</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you shop for makeup, do you start with products in mind, or do you buy things on a whim?</strong> When shopping for my kit, I’m very specific and calculated. But for myself (or my blog) I like to wander around and buy what jumps out at me! Even if I’m just running to the store for toilet paper and bananas, a few beauty products end up in my cart. I clearly cannot be trusted to grocery shop alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a beauty step that you feel should never be skipped?</strong> SPF! Is everyone sick of hearing that yet? Good! It should be like brushing your teeth. You only have one face and taking care of your skin is so important. Your makeup is only as good as your skin underneath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you prefer easygoing, uncomplicated looks, or are you more artsy with your makeup?</strong> I definitely have gone through phases. There was a 3 year period where I rocked a Kardashian level smokey eye EVERY SINGLE DAY. Calm down Jess, right? Now I like to keep my routine under 7 minutes. I only pull out all the stops for special occasions. Daily I like to make sure my complexion is on point, my brows are sculpted, and my lashes are full. Toss in a lipstick and it looks like you tried (but you really didn’t!). I love crazy cool colors and techniques and enjoy the times I use them on myself or clients…but I think for most situations, you should want the people that see you to say “You look lovely!” Not, “Your makeup looks cool!” Both are compliments, but only one is really about you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What beauty product could you never live without?</strong> I’m pretty fanatical about false lashes. I wasn’t born with good ones, so I rarely go a day without them. And lashes can take an everyday look to camera ready fancy in a heartbeat!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What measures do you take to make sure your blog stands out?</strong> I take a more personal approach… even my logo is my handwriting captured digitally. I prefer to write like I talk. And I love sharing about the places I visit and the pro events and photoshoots I do. It’s not just tutorials, it’s not just product reviews, and it’s not just lifestyle info, it’s all of the above! Spending time on my blog should feel like you just had coffee with a good friend. I think my personal approach makes it unique.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has blogging boosted your general creativity when it comes to daily makeup?</strong> Blogging is definitely one of the ways I keep the creative waters flowing. But more so, I would say that blogging has caused me to stop and think of the how and why behind my creativity. The more I understand what I’m doing, the better I am at educating others. And it keeps me on my toes when it comes to doing others makeup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What has launching and maintaining your blog taught you?</strong> It’s been a great lesson in follow through. It’s fun for sure, but it is definitely work. You have to be consistent and confident about the information you’re sharing. I’m constantly challenged to up my game and keep my edge professionally. The industry is literally changing daily, and blogging is a regular pulse check on what’s hot and whether I’m moving forward artistically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring beauty bloggers?</strong> If you want to blog, then just freaking go for it! Don’t wait until you have everything figured out to start. Don’t let your insecurity or the uncertainty of how your friends and family will react keep you from starting. The time lost while you deliberate or wait for some magical ideal phase in your life to start will be just that: time lost.</p>\n"

The self-proclaimed beauty junkie is never without bold brows and bright red lips. By “inspiring women through outfits” that “won’t break the bank”, (her favorite brand is H&amp;M) Tabitha connects with her readers on a more personal level - and we guarantee you will too.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re simply stunning - a classic beauty. What made you want to start blogging?</strong> You are too kind! Thank you! I started blogging in hopes to show women that having great style doesn’t always have to mean luxury. It’s personality. Yes, I will admit that I have expensive taste and I love my investment pieces. But not every woman, including myself, can afford designer pieces all the time. I created The Bobbed Brunette to inspire women through outfits and to show them great style doesn’t have to break the bank.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your eyebrows. Do you fill them? What products do you use to achieve such a flawless face?</strong> I do! I’ve used a few different products over the last few months. My favs have been e.l.f. Studio Eye Brow Kit, Anastasia Brow Wiz, and Make Up Forever eyebrow pencil. I also am obsessed with Revlon’s Photoready foundation! It really helps give that “flawless” look.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What websites or blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> My favorite style blogger is Blair Eadie of Atlantic Pacific. She can do no wrong! I also get inspired by retail stores that come out with seasonal lookbooks. I love to go online and browse through JCrew and H&amp;M’s websites for outfit ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You used to live in NYC! Was the switch hard to NOVA hard? How are you inspired by your new surroundings?</strong> I was born and raised in NYC but I also lived in Florida. Virginia is the perfect median. So no, the switch wasn’t too bad. NOVA is so great because in a short drive north you’re in DC and in a short drive south you’re in Fredericksburg. You get the best of both worlds. It really allows you to experiment with your style without feeling like you’re sticking out and it also provides great variety for photo shoots!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your photos are so artistic and rich, <a href=\"http://www.thebobbedbrunette.com/2014/01/foggy-nights.html\">we can’t stop staring</a>. Who takes your photos?</strong> My husband, Angel, takes the photos. Photography is a hobby of his so the blog is like our baby.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What camera do you use?</strong> Canon 6D.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite small accessory?</strong> My favorite small accessory right now is the midi ring. I love how you can wear as many as you want and they just look so cool!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your eye makeup always looks amazing. Do you frequent any beauty blogs for tips/advice?</strong> Honestly, I haven’t found a beauty blog (yet!) that I frequent for inspiration. I mostly get my tips and advice from makeup artists on Instagram and YouTube. I also have beauty junkie family members who tell me what to do and what products to buy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer? (Try! If you could only shop one brand… what would it be?)</strong> Does H&amp;M count? LOL I love that place and if I could only shop one brand it would be H&amp;M. They’re trendy and affordable, my two favorite things!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Ugh, this is tough! The diva in me wants to say if I can only wear one outfit I’m going to look good! Something all black, under the knee, plunging neckline, and pointy toed shoes. In reality I’ll probably end up in high rise skinny jeans, tucked in collar shirt, and a statement necklace. Oh, and a red lip of course!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the “Statement Necklace” trend?</strong> LOVE! Honestly, it’s my favorite piece of jewelry. It can make the most boring outfit into something “blog worthy”. They can be worn with everything!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plaid or stripes?</strong> Plaid!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding The Bobbed Brunette?</strong> Definitely Instagram. Those hash tags are the best! It really helps with branding because it gives a face (or selfie) to the name.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “People will stare. Make it worth their while.” –Harry Winston</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Blog about what you love and you’ll never run out of things to say! Try not to get discouraged by your number of followers. It’s like having friends - better to have 1 best friend than 10 acquaintances.</p>\n"

Beyond her flavored opinions Camerata runs <strong>My Style Vita</strong>, where she’s developed a true taste not only for fashion, but for the business of fashion. Along with running an impressive blog, Camerata is a co-founder of the influential Southern Blog Society. Styling outfits, trying new recipes, and engaging with other fashion-obsessed bloggers are a few details of this blogger’s exciting and oh-so-fashionable life.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Wow. So My Style Vita has grown so much since we first stumbled across your blog a year or two ago. Do spill! When did you start (exactly) and how did you get to where you are now?</strong> I started officially in April of 2011 (wow just realized it was 2011, so long ago!) to have a writing portfolio. I do have to admit I wasn’t a real deal fashion blogger until mid-2012. I feel like I got a super slow start to it since I had no idea what a blog was when I began. I’d have to say I got to where I am now through consistency, staying true to who I am, partnering with great bloggers and brands and interacting with them on social.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has social media played an important role in the growth of My Style Vita?</strong> Social media is imperative to the success of your blog. The majority of my traffic outside of direct referrals is Twitter (my favorite) so it’s essential to stay on top of it, interact and create great content for my readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re also involved with Southern Blog Society. How did you get into that?</strong> I found it super hard to find other bloggers to meet with, chat with, and become friendly with here in Atlanta. I stumbled onto Poor Little It Girl’s twitter one day and thought I’d shoot her an email since she also lived in Atlanta and seemed to be doing the same thing I was. We instantly clicked and became blogging buds, but after a few months we started talking about how the community needs, well, a community! It shouldn’t have been so hard for us to find each other and from there we developed Southern Blog Society. We joke that it’s like the match.com for blogger friends. I’ve met so many great people through it and actually see them face to face which is important for building relationships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What gives you inspiration for your content?</strong> My everyday life encourages me to create content. I want to find more fun hairstyles to try, so I search for hair inspiration photos and voila, a new beauty post is born. I also love putting outfits together so that’s always fun to do and easy to create content for the site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from your own blog (we hope you are your biggest fan!), do you have a favorite blog?</strong> There’s so many, I have to say Krystal Bick’s This Time Tomorrow was a first of mine that I fell in love with and I think her outfits and closet are just stunning. Kendi Everyday is also a favorite (another first).</p>\n\n<p>A few recent obsessions are A Little Dash Of Darling and A House In The Hills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You cover a few topics on your blog. What’s your favorite to write about, and why?</strong> I think it’ll always be fashion, but I love branching out with the recipe posts. They allow for more personal stories as outfit posts can sometimes be a little dull sometimes unless there’s a good anecdote for the outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was it that made you want to get into blogging originally? Did you have an “ah-ha” moment, were you inspired by something, or did you just want to try it out?</strong> I wanted to build a writing portfolio and had no idea this world even existed. My passion is to write and when someone recommended blogging (my blogging cousin over at The Zhush) I said why not. After a few months I realized I could write the way I want to do it and make it a side job, it was just perfect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s been your favorite personal look published on My Style Vita thus far? Why?</strong> That’s a tough one! I think there’s been several, but recently the black Lulu’s jumpsuit was a favorite. I think because my hair and makeup looked so fierce (it was the day I cut bangs for the first time in 3 years) and it just worked.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mint chocolate chip ice cream or strawberry?</strong> Mint chocolate chip. With extra chocolate sprinkles on top.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cats or dogs?</strong> Dogs, I’m actually a little scared of cats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Embroidery or embossing?</strong> Embossing, but I prefer to be boring and leave things as is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could have done anything differently since you began blogging: what would it be, and why?</strong> I would’ve done more research on blog design and I would’ve gotten me s**t together sooner. I had no idea that you could buy a premade layout and for $30 you can have a beautiful blog. If you saw my blog in the first 6 months, you would totally laugh at me. Horrible! I think now that blogging is becoming so mainstream, these resources are more available, so who knows if that even existed almost 3 years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve had immense success since you hit the ground with My Style Vita - and now Southern Blog Society. If you could offer one piece of advice to aspiring bloggers, what would it be?</strong> Network, network, network. Since we started SBS, I’ve learned that networking and building relationships is vital to the success of your business in any industry. I still have work to do with that, my blog and SBS. Always room for growth, learning and expansion!</p>\n"

I think it’s proof that you can look great for not a ton of money, and unless people read the notations in my outfit posts, they never know the difference!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are some of your favorite designers/brands?</strong> My first answer to this question isn’t really a brand, but I will always choose vintage above all else.  As far as designers go, I love Marni, Suno, Alexander Wang &amp; Erin Fetherston, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What kind of advice can you give to aspiring bloggers?</strong> Figure out how to blog about what you love and then put your own twist on it that no-one else could replicate. A unique edge and genuine voice are the most important. Also, don’t undervalue your influence and go with your gut instinct when it comes to working with site sponsors!</p>\n"

Although “Décor” is visible in the title, the blog’s focus is not solely on interior design. The ladies behind the posts, <strong>Lauren and Marika</strong>, are multifaceted and have peppered in their distinctly Californian personal style. They frequently dabble in a color palette of neutrals, whites and golds. While those hue selections may seem on the safe side, their ensembles are impossible to ignore. With beachy blonde hair, expertly pieced together outfits, and unfaltering smiles, these self-proclaimed “Golden Girls” draw us in to their bright, sunny world. Once there we find dreamy indoor and outdoor scenes and envy inspiring fashion accompanied by thought provoking quotes. Visit the blog to explore for yourself and read on for our exclusive interview with the Golden Girls!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did the idea for Golden White Décor come from?</strong> Golden White Décor stemmed from the desire to share fashion, decor, and words of inspiration with those around the world. The internet is the perfect way to share your creativity and influence others with positivity, anywhere they may be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you decide to combine interior design with personal style?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em> The two worlds play off each other, keeping a classy and sophisticated style. We love the way we can incorporate beautiful interior design elements into the blog, it helps creates an overall aesthetic and lifestyle to our blog. <em><strong>L:</strong></em> We think of our blog as a look book that offers a happy California lifestyle. How we dress, our surroundings, as well as having a positive mindset… all manifests the sunny life we lead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What inspires your personal style?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  Our minds are always thinking and looking around at the world, at other individuals/bloggers, and at different design elements. We look internationally, as many trends begin in Europe, but we always stay true to ourselves and looks that we feel are the most “golden white”. <em><strong>L:</strong></em>  I love European fashion, as well as the European lifestyle. Europeans take time to ENJOY life; we try to convey the beauty of life through our blog. Life is meant to be light, airy, whimsical, and full of glee.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What inspires decor in your own homes?</strong> We love the relaxed California boho style, comfortable and chic, yet we also love the sophistication of European elegance. It is always fun to mix the two. Also, combining the old with the new is something we do as well… for instance finding an old chair and reupholstering it in a beautiful new fabric. There is richness in culture and history… combining elements from the past, and being influenced by different cultural trends brings forth the beauty of design.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your hearts are obviously in California, but do you see a possibility of branching out?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  We are California girls, our hearts will always be here for the long term, but as we travel and are inspired by different areas we will definitely incorporate that into our blog! <em><strong>L:</strong></em> As Marika said, our hearts will always be in California… however, I LOVE Europe and would love to live in London for a while, or even Australia for a bit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Describe your “perfect outfit,” as well as your “dream room.”</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  We are bias to the colors “white” and “gold” (hints the name of our blog). An all white outfit in a beach setting never gets old, but we also love to style outfits that incorporate color, texture and pattern too…the options are endless. <em><strong>L:</strong></em>  Whites, creams, golds, and neutrals have always been my go to. Put me on a white sail boat in Tahiti , outside my white room in the tropics… or in an all white evening gown, in a palace of white and gold… from gypsy to princess… I love it all!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name some of your favorite places to shop. (For clothing and home goods.)</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  We love the small boutique shopping, vintage shops (for jewelry) and working with our favorite brands. <em><strong>L:</strong></em>  Small boutiques and hole in the wall stores are the absolute best! You discover unique pieces, and the best brands for both fashion and home décor!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you both collaborate on posts equally? Is one the fashion guru and one the interiors maven?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  We pretty much collaborate on everything and discuss ideas with each other, it’s all about teamwork although, Lauren is definitely the interior design expert of the two, but its fun to get inspired together or by each other too. <em><strong>L:</strong></em> It is such a blast working together! Marika and I have similar yet different style which keeps it fun, spontaneous, and creative! We inspire one another. For instance, I have more prep to my step, and Marika’s style offers a bit more sass. I love getting her input and collaborating ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What have you learned from your experiences with blogging?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  We want to inspire the world through our personal style and passion. We are continuously growing and creating, but if we can enhance other peoples lives, mindsets, and feelings after looking at the blog then we did our job. <em><strong>L:</strong></em>  Styles, trends, fashion, and décor is ever changing. This parallels us as people: as experiencers we are continually learning, growing, and refashioning our being. We want to inspire people to grow not only through style, but through our positive messages. Blogging has allowed us to grow in learning how to do so!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any future plans you’d like to let us in on?</strong> <em><strong>M:</strong></em>  Every week is something new, blogging is a type of outlet that is “fashion now” so it’s constantly changing and there is always something new and exciting to offer our readers. We love giveaways with our favorite brands and I think these are exciting because they incorporate our fans! <em><strong>L:</strong></em> Marika and I have a plethora of plans for the future including: publishing a book, traveling, and much more! Keep following along to follow some exciting adventures that lie ahead!</p>\n"

How fabulous is that? <strong>Luba Dimitrova</strong> runs the multi-faceted <strong>Well Living Blog</strong>. Dimitrova had to develop the concept for her blog, but today’s content and layout is more than impressive – it’s gorgeous. Aspiring bloggers can take a lot from this Canary Islands based blogger. Her style, recipe knowledge, and business-woman like mentality make Well Living Blog a force to be reckoned with.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, Luba - we love the nude/neutral colors of your blog, and love your European-city inspired content. Tell us about the idea behind Well Living Blog.</strong> So glad to hear that. Thank you! At the very beginning I didn’t have a clear concept in mind but the zest of sharing my vision on Fashion, Lifestyle, Traveling and Gastronomy. These are the major passions of my life. After almost 2 years of blogging Well Living Blog turned to be my creative destiny. It constantly challenges my imagination and wanderlust. More than fashion it is a personal - and lifestyle blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your blog covers fashion, lifestyle, and… food! (Our mouths started watering looking at all of the delicious plates) What’s your favorite column to write for, and why?</strong> Writing is a creative way of expressing thoughts and emotions and for me the most challenging one is the Gourmet column. I find it hard to explain in words the merriment of the palate while tasting delicious flavors or the excitement of discovering new foodie – spoiling spots.\nI also enjoy writing about emerging designers and feature any charity or social projects related to fashion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We love your ombre-fade hair color. It’s beautiful. Was that hard to achieve?</strong> Actually, no. The color you see in my roots is my natural one and having this almost blond shade I only got a bit of clearer shade at the hair ends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a must-wear accessory or wardrobe staple? Something you incorporate into every outfit (or most outfits)?</strong> Yes! A good pair of stilettos</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who’s your favorite shoe designer?</strong> This is a tricky question because… I love shoes! I can’t name just one, but some of my favorites are Gianvito Rossi, Christian Louboutin, Alexandre Birne, Laurence Dacade, Kurt Geiger and Jorge Bischoff</p>\n\n<p><strong>You wear classic red so well, we are super envious! Do you have any tips on mastering the bold color? Teach us!</strong> Red is one of those colors that are very flattering for both blonds and brunettes. I love a pop of it at monochrome looks added by the accessories (shoes or bag) or a powerful red coat to cheer up cold and gray days. I am love pairing red with black, white and denim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite clothing designer? (Try! If you could only shop one brand… what would it be?)</strong> Seriously? Just one? Then anything from Victoria Beckham. But this is still an unfair answer to so many other designers that I truly admire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Skinny jeans and crisp white shirt, paired with 5 inch stilettos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gold or silver?</strong> Both! Depending on my mood and outfit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What trends are you seeing pop up for spring/summer?</strong> I think that we are going to take PJ’s out of our bedrooms and wear again bomber jackets. Candy colors, all shades of blue, yellow, graphic and floral prints will dye our wardrobes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let’s talk beauty! Do you have any rules on makeup? (wearing, buying, etc?)</strong> I rely more on beauty care than on make up. I am a huge organic cosmetic enthusiast and you can find in my boudoir any kind of potions and lotions by Dr. Hauschka, Weleda, Jurlique or Elemental Herbology. Apart from applying make up base and lip gloss I have no idea of how to feature my eyes, that’s why for special events I get my makeup done by my stylist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking into consideration the experience you’ve garnered over the past few years, what’s one piece of essential advice you’d give to an aspiring blogger?</strong> Blogging is such an enriching experience in many ways. However, those who thrive to become a relevant blogger have to consider it as a business. And as any business it requires hard work, time, patience and constancy.</p>\n"

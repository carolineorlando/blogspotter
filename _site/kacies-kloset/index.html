</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you choose a name for your blog?</strong> I came up with my blog name, Kacie’s Kloset, because my name is Kacie and my blog focuses on my personal outfits I put together using items from my closet.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>When you started Kacie’s Kloset, what did you have in mind?</strong> When I started my blog, I just wanted a place to share my outfits, give people a little fashion inspiration, and make them smile or laugh at what I write.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Has it stayed pretty true to that original idea? How has it evolved?</strong> Yes, I think my blog has stayed true to the original idea. Although, I have been thinking about adding a few beauty posts. Many people have been asking for a hair tutorial.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What made you want to share your personal style?</strong> Working from home, I felt like a lot of my cute outfits went to waist. My dogs just didn’t seem to appreciate my good outfits and my husband didn’t have much of an opinion on them either. I love sharing my love for fashion with other fashionistas.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>How would you describe your fashion sense?</strong> I’d describe my style as dressy-casual. I wear a lot of jeans and I’m always in heels.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> I love Marshalls and TJ Maxx because you can find quality items at great prices. I also love Nordstrom. They always have of-the-moment pieces in a wide price range to fit any budget. Gap and Old Navy are also great.

</p>

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Do you take more style cues from streetwear or runway fashion?</strong> I definitely get most of my inspiration from street style.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I get a lot of inspiration from fashion bloggers, celebrities, and my favorite magazine People StyleWatch.

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> Jeans! My two favorites are my medium wash Dittos jeans and black J Brand jeans. I’m also obsessed with my chambray top.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Does social media play a big part in your blogging process? Which sites do you feel are crucial?</strong> I post to all my social media account at least once a day but Instagram is definitely my favorite. Staying active on social media is a very important component of blogging.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>If you could start your blogging journey all over, would you change anything?</strong> I can’t really think of anything I would change. I’ve enjoyed every step along the way. If I had to choose something, I wish I would have thought of a more creative blog name. Although, I can’t think of anything I would want to change it to so Kacie’s Kloset it will stay.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> The importance of time management. I work from home so it would be easy for me to get distracted by everyday household things. Staying organized and focused is key.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> I know it’s cliché to say but the best advice is to be yourself. Your readers want to get to know and connect with you. It’s also important to stay active with the blogging community.

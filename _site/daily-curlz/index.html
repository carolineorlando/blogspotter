    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>You review a lot of beauty products and come up with lots of hair and beauty DIYs. How do you decide which products to try and which DIYs to share?</strong> For the hair products part, a mix of factors influence whether I review it or not, I want to keep a balance in the blog and I don’t want it to be all about reviews, so I always pay attention to my readers comments and requests. New products and trend products also have a big possibility to be reviewed. As for DIY, the inspiration comes every day, I am a mom, so a few hours of my day are spent in the kitchen, I can be doing a carrot juice and hair comes to my mind, is carrot juice good for hair? can I apply it to my hair? I put my apron aside, sit on my computer, do a lot of research and then try it on my own it..

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>You write your posts in both English and Spanish. Why is this important?</strong> This is really important to me, because the Latin community has little information about natural hair, it is double the work but double the satisfaction. Spanish is my language, my identity, quien soy. I love having a voice in a language that latinas can understand and rely on.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You found some gorgeous curls to photograph at New York Fashion Week. How was the experience of attending?</strong> I am in California and my friend (and journalist) Francis was there, so I called her and ask her to cover the event for me. She was surprised on how many women showed up in one of the most important fashion shows wearing their natural texture, where long ago they would be spending hours at a hair salon straightening their hair, women are realizing that natural hair is fashionable and trendy.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> My style is safe, with a touch of modernism. I don’t get drowned in trends, but I do try to get inspiration while sticking to my own style. We can call it casual, to put a name on it… Ever since I went natural though, I am taking more risks and playing with colors and textures that I though weren’t right for my skin color.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What are some of your favorite colors to wear?</strong> Black (lol don’t we all love it) - black is so flattering, but like I said before, I am playing with texture that was prohibited for me.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Do you gravitate more toward basics or bold prints?</strong> Basics all the way, bold prints to have fun and get out of my comfort zone.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What trends are you excited to try this spring?</strong> I am so ready to wear Orange in it’s different hues in clothes, bags, and shoes. The crop tops are so cute and really trendy for spring, but I don’t think I will be wearing it. White wide-legged pants is something I am really excited as well and graphics, prints, and patterns

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"With hard work and consistency, you can achieve anything you want in life." <em>&mdash; Daily Baez</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>What made you first start blogging?</strong> That is a funny story, because I started my Facebook page first and a fan said “you should start a blog”. So I did that very night.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Has your blog changed and grown over time?</strong> Tremendously, I didn’t quite know that I had a voice and that people wanted to hear what I had to say. That made me study and invest in my blog to give my readers better content every day, they give so much love that I can’t do it any other way.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing to happen to you through the blogging process?</strong> A lot of cool stuff has happened to me through blogging, but the coolest thing is the love my readers give me every day through a simple comment, they support me in so many ways that I feel grateful and that is super cool.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What exciting changes or events do you have planned for the future?</strong> I have a lot of plans for my blogging, but in the near future I will be focusing on networking. For that reason I will be attending a few conferences around US and just continuing to be me and do me..

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What is the main message you would like to convey to your readers?</strong> Don’t get caught in stereotypes and what other people think. “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> That with hard work and consistency, you can achieve anything you want in life. Blogging has made me a more confident woman that is able to pass it on to her children, friends and thousands of women that want to hear and read what I have to say.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>Any advice for fellow curly-haired girls, or anyone wanting to start a blog?</strong> Just go for it, but try to write about something that excites you. And be you, because everyone else is taken.

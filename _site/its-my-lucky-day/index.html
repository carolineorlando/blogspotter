    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Shelby Revis</strong> needed a place to chronicle her lively, preppy looks and luck-fueled adventures, and <strong>It’s My Lucky Day</strong> was born. Her bright, cheerful style shines in every post. She looks to movies and music for ideas, and cites Olivia Palermo as street style inspiration.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us why it’s your lucky day!</strong> Here’s the thing – I have this really comical way of winning random contests. I’ve won everything from gift cards to concert tickets and even a trip to Chicago. A lot of my close friends are always like, “You’re literally the luckiest girl EVER”, and so that’s kind of how “It’s My Lucky Day” came about. I wanted a place to share my adventures, and my blog was the perfect opportunity for me to do so!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you choose the name and color scheme for your blog?</strong> About a year ago, I sort of recreated my blog. I had tried blogging for a while, but it was never anything consistent, and I felt like my themes really didn’t match my personality. That changed after my friend and I watched the 2013 Kentucky Derby, and there was a horse named “It’s My Lucky Day.” We both looked at each other and knew that it was a perfect fit for me! I shorten it sometimes to just “Lucky Day”, but I love that it captures my personal style. To me, it’s all about having fun and embracing those moments of good luck. I chose an aqua blue hue because, frankly, I’m a little obsessed with the color. I also love that it gives a fresh and lively feel, complimented by the gold glitter accents that add just the right amount of sparkle.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>What is the process of curating your lively and preppy closet?</strong> I always look for pieces that have a classic appeal with a colorful twist. I love pieces that speak for themselves, like a bright pair of patterned jeans or a bold statement necklace. Being a Florida native, I can get away with wearing these saturated hues all year, making it easy for me to keep my closet lively! When in doubt, I take a note from my prep-school days and go for a solid oxford button-down shirt and a pair of colored chino shorts. I’d have to say that’s probably my signature look!

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Where do you find blogging inspiration?</strong> I find inspiration everywhere! I often look to movies or music to inspire me. My blog is dedicated to my personal style, so I follow a few fashion blogs and keep an updated mood board on Pinterest to help me stay inspired.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Do you use blogging as a creative outlet?</strong> Definitely! I love anything that allows me to express a little creativity, and Lucky Day is no exception! I strive to reflect my creativity and personal style in each and every post.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Will your style change at all when you graduate college and officially join the workforce?</strong> I feel like my style has changed a lot already since I came to college, but I think that just depends on the career path I take. I know it will change because I’m always updating my closet, but to say my everyday looks will become more “professional” would probably be incorrect. If anything, I think my personal style will become a little more refined than it is now!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Do you have any outfit tips for college grads interviewing or starting their first jobs?</strong> I think the best way advice would be to find a balance between looking professional and adding your own flair. I don’t think work-appropriate attire has to be boring! When in doubt, check and see if the company you’re interviewing with has a dress code policy and go from there.

</p>

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Is your fashion sense more girly or tomboy chic?</strong> My style is definitely on the girlier side, but I like to incorporate a few tomboy elements every now and then. I adore anything that has ruffles, sparkle, or a hint of pink. Although, I’m also one to rock a pair of camo skinny pants every once in a while. I think it’s fun to mix things up and wear pieces that are a little out of the ordinary.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Heels or flats?</strong> Heels are pretty, but my shoes of choice are my worn-in Jack Rogers sandals!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you shop more in small boutiques or department stores?</strong> I prefer shopping in boutiques because I feel like they offer more unique looks. I have my fair share of basics from department stores, but somehow I’m always drawn to those pieces in my wardrobe that are from local boutiques. I love having pieces that no one else has!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Who is your number one style icon?</strong> Right now, I’m totally crushing on Blair Eadie from Atlantic-Pacific’s style. I love how she puts together unexpected pieces and patterns. She’s fearless! I’m also a huge fan of Olivia Palermo. Her street style is flawless.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What three items in your closet could you never replace?</strong> My Kate Spade glitter heels, Jackie O pearls, and my Carrie Bradshaw tulle skirt.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has updating and maintaining your blog taught you?</strong> I think the most important thing that I’ve learned through writing on Lucky Day is that you should always remain true to yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in the latest blogger trends and post about what everyone else is posting, but I’ve learned that blogging is more rewarding when you’re posting creative content. You can’t go wrong when you’re being yourself! Your readers will for sure appreciate the originality.

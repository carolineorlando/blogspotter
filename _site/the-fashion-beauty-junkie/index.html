    <p class="p--2 p"><em>Just focusing on fashion or beauty is not enough for <strong>Suma Kaul</strong>. She is a junkie for both. Lucky for us, she posts about each topic, encouraging readers to be themselves in the process. She believes that fashion and beauty go hand in hand, and that a look is not complete without the perfect lip. We couldn’t agree more! Learn more about Suma’s views and her journey as <strong>The Fashion Beauty Junkie</strong>.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> I have been blogging for a little over two years! Crazy.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> I actually had a really hard time coming up with a name in the beginning. I knew I wanted to compile or combine words that I felt was going to describe my blog exactly. After a few combination flops, I finally came up with The Fashion Beauty Junkie, which I am now referred to by the people in my life.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I would describe my personal style as Rocker Gypsy Chic. I love all the elements of being girly but I like to do it with an edge.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> Both! I love pairing simple pieces like a plain white tee with a statement necklace but I also love simplicity when it comes to my accessories.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Where are some of your favorite places to shop and why?</strong> Since I live in NYC, we have amazing Thrift Shops and those are always my go to when I want to mix up my closet for cheap. I also love all the new independent designers I have found through social media!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Who are your favorite designers and why do they inspire you?</strong> I have stuck to the same designers for years and they constantly inspire me and I always want to buy everything in their line. Alexander Wang and Marc Jacobs are my top two. They stay true to who they are and the average girl can feel comfortable wearing their brand.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> This is a pretty hard question because, I am inspired by so many things! So with that being said- I’m going to have to say the environment inspires my style!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Stay true to who you are, no one likes a fake." <em>&mdash; Suma Kaul</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>You post about fashion and beauty. What made you decide on these topics?</strong> Well, it’s pretty simple. Fashion and beauty go hand in hand in my book. When I pick out something to wear, I know my look wouldn’t be complete without the right lip color. I love that I can offer more than an outfit to my readers.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It takes me about 2 days to complete a blog post. One day to write it and one day to edit and revise anything. I feel my brain has a whole new view of the post the next day.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Do you take your own pictures, or do you have help?</strong> My lovely boyfriend Danny is responsible for most of my fashion related photos and I shoot my own beauty related photos. I sometimes have opportunities to work with talented photographers, which I never turn down.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>How has blogging gone for you so far? Do you feel it was a worthwhile endeavor?</strong> Blogging has been an amazing experience for me. I have loved every single moment of it. I really didn’t think anything would come of it, but every time an opportunity comes my way because of my blog, I know it has been totally worth it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you’ve started?</strong> The coolest thing? That’s a tough one. Can I say meeting Lil’ Jon?

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> It has taught me that there’s no such thing as free time. As a blogger, you are constantly working and you have to be a 100% in it to make it! Your readers know and can see the time you put into your blog, so there’s no slacking.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message do you want readers to take away from The Fashion Beauty Junkie?</strong> The main message I want my readers to take away from TFBJ is that life is fun and it’s totally ok to be different. I know that sounds a little cliché but I truly do mean that. I don’t try to be something I am not, and I want my readers to see that.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring fashion and beauty bloggers?</strong> Stay true to who you are, no one likes a fake. People can see if something isn’t your own. Find your voice and go with it!

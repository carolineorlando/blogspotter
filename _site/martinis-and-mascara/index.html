    <p class="p--2 p"><em>She is Allure’s Most Buzzworthy Blogger, and she’s worth buzzing about! Looking for updated beauty tips and secrets? (We all are!) <strong>Katie McBroom</strong> of <strong>Martinis and Mascara</strong> is ready to share. From her hair care must-haves to her collection obsessions, she reveals it all. This is one blog you’ll be visiting nonstop to see the latest. Learn more about Katie and see what the buzz is about with Blogspotter!</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>You’ve had immense success with your blog, Martinis and Mascara. From Allure Beauty Awards (you were a finalist!) to a soon-to-be column with Giuliana Rancic’s “FabFitFun” - we’re so inspired! Tell us a little bit about Martinis and Mascara.</strong> Thank you so much! Winning the title of Allure’s Most Buzzworthy Blogger has been absolutely amazing and opened up so many doors for me! I’m thrilled to start my column on Giuliana Rancic’s FabFitFun soon too. Martinis and Mascara is a blog devoted to all things beauty (and occasionally, cocktails!) where I feature beauty product news, reviews, and advice – all served to you straight up!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for? I launched Martinis and Mascara in Feb. 2012, but I’ve been writing about beauty for various publications for close to eight years now. Did you formally study makeup/beauty?</strong> I did! I received my certification in professional makeup artistry from Joe Blasco Makeup School in 2007. After that I attended cosmetology school and am currently a licensed cosmetologist as well.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You’re pretty big on the creative scene. Do you find that being a creative person in general helps you with the upkeep and maintenance surrounding your blog?</strong> I think being involved in several different creative outlets helps to cultivate ideas for sure. I genuinely enjoy all aspects of beauty blogging too – makeup, writing, photography, etc. – so I think that makes things easier as well because it doesn’t feel like work.

      </aside>
      

      

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>What’s your favorite must-use beauty product?</strong> Image Skincare Ormedic Balancing Lip Enhancement Complex. I have a tube on me at all times!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Gush: what’s your favorite drugstore brand?</strong> That’s such a toughie! I’d say it’s a tie between CoverGirl and Sonia Kashuk

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Tell us about your look: you seem to emulate that pin-up girl look so well! Is that your signature “beauty” style? If not, what is?</strong> Thank you so much! I love to wear the pin-up look because I love that era, but it also works well with my skin tone and coloring. I also love a smokey eye and a light pink lip every now and then.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you began blogging?</strong>
It seems like cool things keep popping up all over (which is amazing!), but being featured in Allure is still my favorite.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"It's amazing how many new people you can reach with a simple hashtag or by being retweeted by a brand." <em>&mdash; Katie McBroom</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How did you stumble into all of the amazing press you’ve had thus far? Have you had to push for it, or do you find that people come to you?</strong> For the most part it has been people reaching out to me… which I am so thankful for!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Let’s talk about networking and social media: do you find that social platforms have helped with the success of Martinis and Mascara? How so?</strong> Social media has helped tremendously! I find that social platforms, especially Twitter, have boosted my readership so much. It’s amazing how many new people you can reach with a simple hashtag or by being retweeted by a brand.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Blue!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Red or nude lipstick?</strong> I like them both, but I love a good red lip!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Glitter or shimmer eyeshadow?</strong> I know I shouldn’t say this, but I’m going with glitter.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>If you only had one beauty product in your arsenal, what would it be, and why?</strong> Mascara! It opens the eye and I think it makes you look beautiful instantly even if you have nothing else on your face.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>A picture is worth 1,000 words - especially when it comes to beauty. Do you have any tips/tricks/must-use photography techniques that you always implement when snapping away for Martinis and Mascara?</strong> Lighting is key! I try to make sure my photos are always well lit so it really showcases the true colors of the products I’m shooting. I also like to make sure the photos are clean and not too busy. If I’m shooting a photo of myself I make sure to always utilize the proper (aka flattering) angles (taken from above at a diagonal, facing the light source).

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to your best friend, who just told you she was going to launch a beauty blog, what would it be and why?</strong> I would tell her to dive in head first and just keep swimming! So many people get into it and want to put a timeline on when they’ll have a big audience or when they’ll make a lot of money… but I think if you just keep plugging along, all of those things will fall into place.

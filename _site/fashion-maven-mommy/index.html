    <p class="p--2 p"><em>To be a fashion maven AND a mommy is a beautiful thing. <strong>Carla Kokoszka</strong> proves that with her informed musings on fashion and beauty. Even through her busy life, she keeps us updated on what makeup products to try and what looks she’s loving. Her pretty little ones occasionally make an appearance, adding an extra pinch of delight to her posts. “A cup of beauty with a sprinkle of fashion,” <strong>Fashion Maven… Mommy</strong> is likely to become your latest obsession.</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us about Fashion Maven Mommy!</strong> Fashion Maven Mommy is a collection of all things beauty and fashion that I’ve personally fallen in love with. I made a conscious decision early on to keep my blog positive… you will not find any negativity here! If I’ve tried it and loved it, I enjoy sharing it with my readers! It is best described as a cup of beauty with a sprinkle of fashion!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>When did you begin blogging, and what was it that gave you the inspiration and idea for Fashion Maven Mommy?</strong> I embarked on this pretty little journey, Fashion Maven Mommy in December 2011. After years and years of searching for a creative outlet, it finally occurred to me… I could blog! From that very moment, everything changed. I felt as though I could finally exhale! This was a new chapter and I couldn’t wait to see where this wonderful road would take me! Initially, I thought this was going to be a fashion blog (hence the name), however, my love for beauty really took center stage and so I just went with it. I guess you can say I’m an accidental beauty blogger!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You were a finalist in Allure’s Beauty Blogger of the Year Awards - how exciting! How did you get involved with the competition, and what did you learn from it?</strong> About two months into blogging, while searching for a way to take my blog to the next level, I came across a double page spread in Allure Magazine. It was as though the universe spoke to me directly. And if the universe speaks… you listen right?! I could hardly believe it when I got the call that I was selected as an alternate! Yes, an alternate… this was the first time around! I literally spent the entire year perfecting my blog with a single mission… to make it to the actual contest the following year! I entered again and I could barely contain my excitement when I got the call from Allure telling me that they totally remembered my blog and loved it. And just like that… I was officially one of the 10 finalists! Best. Day. Ever!

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>You’re a beauty blogger and a mother - how do you find time to balance it all? Do you set a personal schedule or weekly goals to keep everything up-to-date?</strong> It’s definitely a challenge juggling it all. I take my ‘mommy duties’ very seriously! However, I whole heartedly believe that when you are passionate about something, you just make the time. After tucking my girls to bed, I officially switch to FMM mode. It’s exhausting, yes, but so rewarding! I do keep a journal of ideas and posts that I need to complete. However, when I begin to feel pressure to complete a post I try and remind myself that this is not my job. I never want it to feel like a job! This is my passion and I much prefer to write from the heart. So if one week I complete two posts and another week I complete five, that’s OK!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What’s your favorite beauty brand?</strong> OMG do I have to pick just one?! I have soooooo many that I love equally… Stila, NARS, MAC, Urban Decay, Benefit… the list goes on and on!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Straight hair or waves?</strong> Both!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>If you could only have one beauty product in your arsenal - what would it be, and why?</strong> It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye is pretty much the holy grail of concealers! And let’s face it, as a mommy of twins, I’m often sleep deprived! This baby continuously saves my life!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Believe in yourself and blog from the heart! Stay true to yourself and what you love to do. I know it sounds cliché but truthfully, your heart will never steer your wrong!" <em>&mdash; Carla Kokoszka</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Liquid eyeliner or pencil eyeliner?</strong> My current obsession is a great liquid liner pen! I love a fierce cat eye… meow!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What makeup artists do you look to for inspiration?</strong> I’m a huge fan of Sarah Lucero of Stila! I’ve recreated many looks inspired by her work on my blog. She’s just such a talent, and while I don’t know her personally, I feel like she must be the most amazing person. I’d love to meet her some day. Most recently, I became obsessed with the gorgeous looks she created for the Alice and Olivia show during Fall 2014 NYFW. Major blog inspiration right there!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Twitter or Pinterest?</strong> Both! They’re so different! Twitter is a great place to share a thought or two. Pinterest is a place of inspiration, organization and major distraction! I spend way too much time pinning all kinds of wonderful things that I will never do! But still… it’s there just in case!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What’s the coolest thing that’s happened to you since you started blogging?</strong> Hands down, being a finalist in Allure’s BBA! That was such a major moment for me! I mean… hello! Allure = beauty bible!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Let’s talk about social media: do you find that social media has been vital to the success of Fashion Maven Mommy?</strong> Absolutely, social media is a beautiful thing! I’ve met some wonderful friends, amazing bloggers and I can’t wait to meet more! Instagram is my current fave! I just love the instant gratification factor.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> Blogging has taught me to believe in myself and in my dreams! Who would have thought when I began this little journey of mine that Allure Magazine would take notice! It just goes to show… if you have a passion for something, pursue it! If it comes from the heart… then it’s right!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to an aspiring blogger, what would it be, and why?</strong> Believe in yourself and blog from the heart! Stay true to yourself and what you love to do. I know it sounds cliché but truthfully, your heart will never steer your wrong! Well, maybe a few times in High School but you know what I mean!

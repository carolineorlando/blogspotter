    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Kat Chang</strong> of <strong>Love and Ace</strong> began blogging to share the stories of artists and designers. She works full-time in PR, which provides her with a unique outlook on blogging. She describes her style as “casual and easy” (she lives right by the beach in Santa Monica) and is excited about maxi dresses and long rompers this season. Meet the Cali girl behind Love and Ace with Blogspotter.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us a little bit about your blog. What made you decide to launch Love and Ace, and what was it that really made you want begin blogging?</strong> I was freelancing at an e-commerce company and part of what I did was interview the artists and designers we featured in our newsletters. Everyone had such a unique story of how they got started, their creative processes and inspirations. I decided to start a blog that focused on sharing the stories of these designers. I mixed in my own outfit posts as time went along to spice up the content. That’s why I call my blog a semi-personal style blog – it’s a mix of my own personal style and interviews with designers.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging for?</strong> I started in the Summer of 2012 so about a year and a half now.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>What blogs do you look to for daily inspiration? Do you have any must-visit blogs?</strong> I read so many blogs! But my daily go to’s are Who What Wear, Refinery29, Fashiontoast, Caroline’s Mode, The Window (Barney’s blog) and Oracle Fox.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Did you study fashion and/or style as an undergraduate? If not, how did you learn the ins-and-outs of the industry?</strong> I was actually a psychology major in college and I currently work in tech PR so completely the opposite of fashion! However, I’ve always had a passion for all things fashion. I followed a lot of personal style blogs before I decided to start one of my own. It’s definitely a “learn as you go” experience for me. I feel like I’ve learned so much from my first post but I also have so much more to learn. I use the Blogger platform, which is really easy and user friendly. From there I watched a lot of youtube tutorials on how to customize my blog, design a logo, create widgets, etc. I googled, a lot! Being in PR, although in the tech space, also helps since I get to see what it’s like from the other side and how to effectively approach brands and start a relationship with them.

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Who’s your favorite clothing designer?</strong> Amber Kekich-Purling, the designer of LA based AGAIN, has such an eye for texture and shapes. I’m also a huge fan of Odylene, another LA brand has the most gorgeous dreamy dresses. I was also just at fashion week and got to see the Mara Hoffman show, she’s incredible!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What are your favorite trends this season?</strong> For Spring, I’m excited to wear maxi dresses and long rompers - super effortless. And I love anything in white!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>Do you have a favorite accessory - something that you wear everyday?</strong> I have a few simple and rings stackable rings by Gorjana and Griffin that I wear everyday along with my wedding band.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Success doesn't happen overnight but if you keep working hard it will definitely pay off." <em>&mdash; Kat Chang</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong> I grew up right by the beach, in Santa Monica (and I still live here) so my style tends to be casual and easy – lots of shorts, comfy tees, jeans and summer dresses.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Your husband takes your photos for you - what kind of camera does he use?</strong> He uses a Cannon 5d mark II. I’m so thankful that he finds the time to snap photos for me!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>QUICK! What’s your favorite color?</strong> Black

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Cupcakes or brownies?</strong> Brownies

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Pistachio or mint chocolate chip ice cream?</strong> Mint chocolate chip!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with the growth of Love and Ace?</strong> Definitely Instagram I think it’s a great way to engage with the fashion community - whether that’s with other bloggers or brands. I think Instagram definitely helps with the grown of Love and Ace - I have discovered a lot of great blogs via Instagram and I’ve had people find me the same way.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>If you could offer a few words of wisdom to an aspiring blogger, what would they be?</strong> Be consistent with posting! I think it’s important to be able to post at least twice a week, readers don’t want to show up and see content from last week. And of course, be patient. Success doesn’t happen overnight but if you keep working hard it will definitely pay off!

    <p class="p--2 p"><em>Fresh from studying fashion in Milan, <strong>Alyssa Robinson</strong> of <strong>The Leather Skinny</strong> needed an outlet for her newly fine-tuned personal style, and her blog was born. She takes inspiration from everywhere, including her fellow bloggers, and is leather pants and dainty jewelry obsessed. She is a firm believer that fashion should be fun, and that’s what blogging is all about! Get to know Alyssa through her Blogspotter questionnaire.</em>

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and what made you start?</strong> Less than a year. I have always been in love with fashion and after studying Fashion in Milan I really decided to fine tune my own personal style. Once I got that down I decided to document it and just have fun being myself. I was a huge blog follower before I ever had the time or ideas to start my own.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you come up with a name for your blog?</strong> The name for my blog was actually the hardest part about creating my blog. It came to me one day because I decided I wanted to add fitness fashion to my blog concept. I am such a fitness freak but also obsessed with fashion and leather so ‘The Leather Skinny’ fit perfectly. It speaks to the fashion aspect of my blog as well as the fitness aspect.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You post mostly personal style. Give us a brief description of yours.</strong> My personal style is relatively simple. I love anything leather and usually have either leather pants or a leather jacket on at any given time. But I also love to play with textures and prints, silk and leather is one of favorites mixes. I also like to keep things clean, never too much jewelry, I prefer to keep the focus on the clothing I am wearing. And I am a shoe HOARDER, it seriously is a problem but I have.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>What has starting and maintaining a blog taught you?</strong> A lot! It’s consistent work and that is the hardest part about it, you have to be on top of every post and even plan weeks in advance for future posts. It is very interesting. In fact, when I started my blog is was going to be just for fun and really at my own leisure (almost a way to document my awesome outfit ideas for use later!) but then I got such amazing feedback and found that my very small following of people really were waiting for my next outfit post because it then inspired them! That is the most incredible part about blogging, you really do reach more people than you can even imagine and it is so much fun to know that you helped someone come up with an outfit for that night out or whatever occasion!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>What are some of your favorite prints to wear?</strong> I love star prints and some edgier floral prints.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Where are your go-to places to shop and why?</strong> Aritzia, because they have the best basics, Revolve Clothing because they carry unique brands that you can’t find anywhere else and Shopbop because they simply have everything.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What is your main source of style inspiration?</strong> I get inspiration everywhere, from someone walking on the street to magazines. Most often, though, I get inspiration from my fellow bloggers! I love to browse some of my favorite blogs and pull ideas and inspiration directly from them!

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"I was a huge blog follower before I ever had the time or ideas to start my own." <em>&mdash; Alyssa Robinson</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> All of my leather pants and every single one of my Equipment silk blouses. Obsessed with both. I swear I will be buried in leather pants.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Basics with bold accessories, or standout pieces with dainty jewelry?</strong> I actually prefer basics with dainty jewelry 90% of the time. Occasionally I will add a statement necklace or statement earrings but I love dainty gold jewelry I just think it is so classic.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Name some of your style icons.</strong> Nicole Richie POST babies, she is un-real when it comes to cutting edge fashion and taking risks. I love that about her. Never do I see a picture of her and think ‘Oh man I would never wear that’, it just never happens.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>About how long does an average blog post take?</strong> It really depends on what the post is about. If it is just an outfit then it is very quick and easy especially if I already have the pictures! If it is more of a wordy post then it takes a bit longer because I become OCD about grammar, spelling and all that jazz. But ultimately my blog is just me posting what I feel at that particular moement and so it never takes too long.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Do you take your own photographs, or do you have help?</strong> My loving, wonderful boyfriend gets dragged along with me to take my pictures! He actually has a really unique and artsy eye that helps when coming up with locations and poses! One of the many, many reasons I love him to death!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>Neutrals or bold hues?</strong> Neutrals, hands down. Neutrals worn right are bold in themselves.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What main message would you like to convey to your readers?</strong> Just have fun with fashion! It is supposed to be unique and self-inspired and reflect who YOU are as a person. I have definitely had my moments where I may have ended up in US Weekly’s ‘What NOT To Wear’, but that is what makes fashion so fun!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring personal style bloggers?</strong> Definitely be yourself. I can’t tell you how many times I have come across blogs that seem forced and unnatural. And readers see right through that! No one is perfect and that is what makes a reader connect with your blog!

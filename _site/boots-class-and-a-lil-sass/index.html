    <p class="p--2 p"><em><strong>Kayla Louise Johnson</strong> of <strong>Boots Class &amp; A lil Sass</strong> knows a thing or two about, well - boots, class, and sass! The Star Valley, Wyoming native is not only a fashion and style blogger, she’s a cosmetologist and makeup artist (she’s really amazing!). Kayla adores cowboy boots, prefers matte finishes over metallic, opts for pops of pink over pops of yellow (but it’s a close call!), and lives by the quote “the only person I’m trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday”. And sassy is OK, as long as it’s mixed with an equal part of classy. Meet the stunning blonde behind Boots Class &amp; A lil Sass with Blogspotter today.</em>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us a little bit about yourself and your blog, “Boots Class &amp; A Lil Sass” (cutest name, ever!)</strong> Thank you! Well I’m from a small town in Wyoming; I have always had a passion for fashion. I would constantly go to the local grocery store to buy magazines (the closest ‘city’ was 2 hours away) so I would find anyway to stay up-to-date on the latest fashion &amp; beauty trends. Then I went to become a cosmetologist &amp; makeup artist, dashed in with a few other professions. The Boots Class &amp; A lil Sass came from my LOVE for cowboy boots, a reminder to always be classy &amp; a maybe just a little bit sassy… but always in a cute fun way!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>You’re absolutely stunning - and we love your golden-girl-meets-sassy-chic style. What made you want to start blogging?</strong> Awe well thank you so much! Well I started my blog more as a self-expression and I wanted to share my love for fashion &amp; beauty with others. If I could give any fashion inspiration to anyone or any makeup tips &amp; someone benefited from them, it makes it all worthwhile!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>You have such an interesting background! How do you balance everything so well? Any tips regarding time management?</strong> If it’s important to you, you will make time. I grew up with a dad who is such an incredibly hard worker &amp; I rarely saw him complain. He managed his time by making what he did a priority. I guess I picked that up &amp; it motivated me use my time wisely.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Your outfits always incorporate flowing long blonde hair and bold accessory accents. If you only had one must-wear accessory in your closet, what would it be - and why?</strong> My bracelet stacks, for sure. They can be dressed up or dressed down. A good set of bracelets go with anything!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>Where did you grow up? Does location heavily influence your style?</strong> Star Valley, Wyoming. Absolutely, my favorite outfits reflect from being from Wyoming. A little western-rustic-casual vibe is my fave!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “The only person I’m trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday.” It’s important to only be in competition with yourself, and to push yourself everyday to be a better person. Also it’s incredibly important to ALWAYS be yourself - everyone else is already taken.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>What websites or blogs do you look to for daily inspiration?</strong> I love ModaMob.com, Polyvore, Pinterest of course, &amp; following tons of style bloggers</td>
      <td>stores on instagram!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?</strong> Turks &amp; Caicos

      <blockquote>"If you stay true to yourself and the blog you poured your heart into, it will pay off." <em>&mdash; Kayla Louise Johnson</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Crisp white tee, distressed cut offs, cowboy boots or converse, killer bracelet stacks, long stacked dainty necklaces

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>Glitter or sequins?</strong> Sequins

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>A pop of pink or yellow?</strong> This is tricky… pink!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Metallic or matte?</strong> Matte

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Do you ever reach out to other bloggers for advice or networking? Have you made blogger friends in the industry? If so, how did you go about doing that?</strong> When I first started out, I reached out to a few bloggers (some who never responded) but I didn’t get discouraged, the ones who did were so nice &amp; helpful. Most bloggers have a ‘contact me’ on their site so it made it easy to shoot a message and get some advice.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform? Do you find that it helps you with branding Boots Class &amp; A Lil Sass?</strong> Instagram and Pinterest by far! Yes - absolutely it helps!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What’s one thing that blogging has taught you that you did not expect to learn?</strong> How much work goes into a blog and building up your site. The time that is put in to making it reflect who you are as a blogger and a person. The importance of details and making sure you never lose sight of who you are and the reason why you started blogging.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--17 p"><strong>If your best friend was about to launch a fashion/style blog tomorrow, what’s one piece of must-have advice you would give her?</strong> To not give up, it doesn’t matter how many readers you have as long as you are fulfilling what you set out to do with your blog. If you stay true to yourself and the blog you poured your heart into, it will pay off. When you receive that first email or comment from someone asking how you did your hair or where you got that certain accessory or any advice, I promise you will get such a sense of reassurance and pride in what you’re doing. It makes it that much more meaningful. Xoxo babes!

Beginning as a creative outlet in 2010, Kinney’s blog has transformed into a style resource for men and women. Trophy Boutique showcases “Before and After” transformations that ensures readers of her styling abilities.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Tell us a little bit about Trophy Boutique!</strong> Trophy Boutique is a personal styling business dedicated to helping men &amp; women creatively and effortlessly express their personalities through their individual style. The Trophy Boutique blog is where I informally talk to my clients and potential clients, share outfit ideas, tips, and tricks and get to express my own personal style.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>How did you get into styling? Did you start blogging first, or vice versa?</strong> I began Trophy Boutique in blog form as a creative outlet in 2010. It began as a way to figure out how to shift my career from social work into fashion. I basically just photographed my outfit each day until I ended up meeting a personal stylist who showed me the ropes. I fell in love with personal styling, working with people to make them feel more confident and stylish, and have been building my business ever since!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>Austin is such a beautiful place, filled with such unique style. How does living in Austin, Texas influence your style?</strong> Austin is great because you can really do your own thing without anyone blinking an eye. I mean, there’s a guy here that rides his bike around town in nothing but a g-string! I love to mix dressy pieces with casual ones so that you can basically go anywhere or do anything and not feel out of place.

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>Did you formally study fashion and styling? If not, what did you focus on in college?</strong> I didn’t ever study fashion formally, but have had fashion magazines delivered monthly since I was 12 years old. I’ve always experimented with and had fun with fashion—I can’t ever remember a time when I wasn’t interested in trying to figure out how to never wear the exact same outfit twice. In college I studied psychology and art and I also have a Masters in social work from Columbia. I love figuring out what makes people tick and how to help people feel better, and styling has become my unique brand of therapy.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>We love the “before and after” section of your website. Why do your clients work with you?</strong> Thanks! My clients are the coolest. I think I typically get hired by people who want to make a change and are a little nervous to open up in this way. I offer a judgment-free, not-so-serious approach that makes the process comfortable and easy. I don’t have a bunch of specific, hard and fast rules that people must follow, instead I approach my clients as individuals, and help them discover what makes them feel best based on who they are as people.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>Quick question: what’s your favorite small accessory?</strong> My rings! I just started wearing a bunch of rings in the past few years and now I feel all weird and naked without them.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>If you had to size up your personal style in a few words…</strong> I would say that my style is comfortable and modern with a touch of androgyny. I used to be a lot more colorful and girly, but lately I’ve been appreciating more minimalism.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Be yourself.  Don't get too caught up in what other people are doing." <em>&mdash; Laurel Kinney</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>If you could only wear one outfit everyday for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong> Probably a drapey top, skinny jeans, chunky ankle boots, and a structured leather jacket or blazer.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What’s your favorite social media platform?</strong> Instagram, 100%. I think it’s the most creative and I love being able to keep a pretty album to remember the little moments.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>What quote or mantra do you live by?</strong> “You have everything you need.” It’s difficult for me to just be appreciative of what I have in the present—I’m always thinking ahead to where I want to go next. I have a poster on my bedroom wall with that phrase on it in giant letters to remind me to stay in a “having” state of being.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>Any advice for aspiring bloggers?</strong> Be yourself. Don’t get too caught up in what other people are doing. Only do or say what comes naturally to you, otherwise it will come off as phony to your readers. To me, connection is the most important thing, so when I post, I imagine I’m talking to the exact type of person I want to connect with, and that helps keep me focused, authentic, and consistent.

    <p class="p--3 p"><strong>Do you feel that your southern location in Houston, Texas influences your personal style?</strong> Absolutely! I have lived in Houston my entire life and have a southern soul and fashion sense. I truly believe that fashion varies in different regions of the United States. As for my personal style, I gravitate to pastels, plaids, seersucker, and bright patterns (think Lilly Pulitzer!). All of these make me think of southern style. I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, and I saw a big difference in fashion up there! Living in Houston has definitely helped to define how my style is today.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--4 p"><strong>You vow to wear every outfit more than once. Why is this important?</strong>
I actually haven’t always been this way! I used to think an outfit could be worn only once. One and done, as they say. I slowly have come to realize that an outfit can be mixed and matched in such a way, that you would never even remember you had worn it before! I love to take pieces from a certain outfit and mix it in different ways so that it feels new to me. I finally feel like I’m getting more bang for my fashion buck, and that’s important.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--5 p"><strong>How long have you been blogging and why did you start?</strong> I have only been blogging since January of this year! I absolutely love it. I majored in fashion merchandising in college, and my job has nothing to do with fashion. Blogging has been the perfect outlet for me to do the thing I enjoy so much. It lets me be creative and I have fun with it!

    <p class="p--6 p"><strong>How did you come up with the name for your blog?</strong> Simply put, I have always had a thing for well, fancy things. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t discriminate when it comes to fashion, but it is no surprise that I love to dress fancy, see fancy places, and just simply be fancy. This name just seemed perfect.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--7 p"><strong>You post mostly about personal style. How would you describe yours?</strong> I would describe my style as classic, feminine, and fun. I love a good classic piece that can be worn time and time again in different ways. I love to match a piece like this in a fun way, tying in current fashion trends. My feminine style shows through my skirts, heels, and fun accessories. While I do follow current fashion trends, I love to dress how I feel most comfortable in my own skin.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--8 p"><strong>You are marrying your best friend in April. Can you give us some hints about your bridal style?</strong> Fancy! Who would have thought? Ever since I was a little girl, I have always known I did not want a Cinderella-style wedding gown. I am 5’11 and knew I wanted something that would accentuate that, while still being classic. I knew I wanted a hint of sparkle, without being over the top. Without giving too much away (yet!), I found the most perfect dress, feminine, elegant, and perfect for me.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--9 p"><strong>What was the process of starting your blog like?</strong> A lot of work! But so, SO, worth it! I think people look at blogging and think it’s all glamorous and easy, but in reality, a lot of work is put into it! I had a fabulous website designer that made my process a thousand times easier, thank goodness. In every post, a lot goes into it! While you may only post 6 or 8 pictures in any given post, there are probably about 75 pictures that are taken! Then, these are narrowed down and edited, resulting in the final few that make the cut for the post. I also try to be pretty vocal on my posts, really describing what I am wearing, why I chose it, what else I would pair it with, etc. So, like I said, a lot of work goes into this! But it is absolutely worth every second.

</p>
    
      

      

      
      <blockquote>"Accessories really are everything. They can turn something ordinary into something fabulous in a matter of seconds." <em>&mdash; Kate Glapa</em></blockquote>
      

    <p class="p--10 p"><strong>Do you ever want to delve into other categories, like beauty?</strong> Yes! Right now, I am focusing on fashion, because that’s what I feel I am best at. I have however, had many questions on my hair and makeup styling, so I would love to eventually dabble in beauty as well!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--11 p"><strong>What is the coolest thing that’s happened since you started blogging?</strong> Honestly, so far it’s been the fabulous other women I have connected with! There are so many talented, fashionable women who blog, that I look up to so much! I love that the blogging community is so open and welcoming, ideas are shared, advice is given, and we all just have fun doing what we love!

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--12 p"><strong>Which item(s) in your wardrobe could you never live without?</strong> My J.Crew white button down shirt, my black Nine West point-toe pumps, my Louis Vuitton bag, my Gap boyfriend jeans, and my Michael Kors Runway Watch. Like I said before, I am all about classics. At least one of these pieces pop up in my outfits several times a week. They’re staples in my wardrobe and can really go with just about anything.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--13 p"><strong>What are your go-to colors?</strong> If I said pink would you be shocked? I love pinks, yellows, and blues. Those are probably my most worn colors. I tend to be drawn to those when I am out shopping.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--14 p"><strong>Are you more into basics or trendy pieces?</strong> Can I say both? If you’ve read my previous answers, you already know how I feel about classics. Basics are great, but I also love to mix in trendy pieces as well! I really like to give every trend a try, and sometimes I really end up loving it.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--15 p"><strong>How important is it to accessorize?</strong> KEY. 100% important. There have been days when I throw on a pair of boyfriend jeans and a plain v-neck tee and just feel really blah. Simple solution? A stunner of a necklace and a great handbag, and I am good to go! Accessories really are everything. They can turn something ordinary into something fabulous in a matter of seconds.

</p>
    
      

      

      

    <p class="p--16 p"><strong>What advice do you have for people stuck in a style rut?</strong> Pick a current trend and just go for it! What do you have to lose? If you don’t like it, that’s okay! But it can’t hurt to try. Some people will be surprised with how it turns out. I used to be opposed to patterns, and now I’m drawn to the brightest, boldest patterns out there! If you’re still hesitant, ease into it. If you wear neutral colors, start small. Add a colored necklace or a pair of colored shoes to an outfit and see how that makes you feel. I admit, some trends can seem intimidating at first! But like I said, if you feel like you’re in a rut, GO FOR IT! It’s the best way to turn your wardrobe around.
